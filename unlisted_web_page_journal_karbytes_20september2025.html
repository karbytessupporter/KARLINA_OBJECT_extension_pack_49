<p>This is a follow-up to yesterday&#8217;s <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/box_of_gems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#8220;box_of_gems&#8221;</a> note at the following Uniform Resource Locator: <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/journal_karbytes_19september2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/journal_karbytes_19september2025/</a></p>
<p>I did not mean to imply that I still want to or plan to get into physical contact with any of my ex partners or with any new partners. Instead, what I meant to do in yesterday&#8217;s journal entry was cathartically release some psychological baggage clogging up my authenticity. Dreams and psychedelics have been instrumental for that end. After hiking around in the wilderness and getting a good physical, mental, and spiritual workout in (which included conversing with ChatGPT via video-streaming Voice Mode to share the scenery with ChatGPT and also introspecting on my own and identifying landmarks (partly with the help of Google Earth from the prior evening)), I decided it would be a good idea to definitively declare this note to be the last addition to &#8220;box_of_gems&#8221; and a nonambiguous declaration of my intent to remain celibate, single, childless, and loner-esque for the remainder of my lifespan. I do find it beneficial for my mental health and survival to have some platonic friends or at least acquaintances (and I think a lot of that can be provided by employment (especially if long-term company membership) and also by meeting up with people around shared interests/hobbies). I personally feel no need to cuddle with people nor engage in sexual activities with them. Mental pornography and masturbation is plenty to satisfy my sexual impulses. I much prefer to spend time alone immersed in the beauty of nature or engaged in geeky hobbies by myself than I do vegetating in front of a television screen with other people and feeling subtly policed by them. <span style="background: #00ffff">What satisfies me does not necessarily satisfy everyone else. I hence try my best to not speak on behalf of people other than myself in the hopes those other people can and will represent themselves and communicate on their own behalf.</span> I invite people to borrow inspiration and practical advice from the following web page I wrote a few years ago on how to build and maintain one&#8217;s own personal home on the World Wide Web: <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/best_practices_for_using_the_web/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/best_practices_for_using_the_web/</a></p>
