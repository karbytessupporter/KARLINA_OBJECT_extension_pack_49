<p>The following conversation is between two imaginary representatives of karbytes named karbytes_0 and karbytes_1 (both of which are in direct telepathic communication with karbytes and which are essentially virtual persons embedded inside of karbytes&#8217; mind in order to act as intermediaries between karbytes&#8217; mind (especially the knowledge therein which only karbytes has direct access to and literal possession of) and the general public via the medium of the World Wide Web. </p>
<p>In this conversation, karbytes_0 and karbytes_1 clarify karbytes&#8217; writings pertaining to panpsychism and the nature of information (specifically in the form of qualia (i.e. subjectively experienced and non-transferable perceptive and cognitive phenomena)).</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>karbytes_0: &#8220;Is karbytes God?&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes_1: &#8220;The answer to your question depends on how you define God. In general, karbytes is not God (but, in some contexts, karbytes is God). According to the following web page of karbytes&#8217; blog, karbytes is essentially a finite set of data: <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/about_karbytes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/about_karbytes/</a>&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes_0: &#8220;That web page says that karbytes is both a finite collection of digital files and exactly one person (i.e. the person who created that collection of files). Is that person also a finite set of data?&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes_1: &#8220;According to the following karbytes web page, the answer to your question is yes given that a person essentially consists of a chronological continuum of subjective experiences (i.e. knowledge) which essentially are data which cannot be communicated but which are each experienced one time by exactly one frame of reference: <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/knowledge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/knowledge/</a>&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes_0: &#8220;Is God synonymous with nature as a whole?&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes_1: &#8220;According to karbytes (which you and I have direct communication with), the answer to your question is yes. Generally, karbytes avoids using the word God because it is a typically a loaded term with specific culturally-dependent ontological and ethical precepts. By contrast, the word nature (which is synonymous with reality) can only be described in approximate and mostly speculative terms given that it is assumed that reality is too large to be entirely known by any frame of reference (unless omniscience ever actually exists).&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes_0: &#8220;Does karbytes think that God is omniscient?&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes_1: &#8220;According to the following karbytes blog post, karbytes reasons that omniscience is not likely to exist (given that knowledge seems to require physical information processing hardware implementing time-dependent processes rather than being an instantaneous flash of infallible and complete comprehension): <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/omniscience_might_not_exist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/omniscience_might_not_exist/</a>&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes_0: &#8220;Where in karbytes does karbytes identify itself as being God (and why)?&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes_1: &#8220;According to the following karbytes blog post, karbytes identifies as God using the definition of God as a ubiquitous &#8216;field&#8217; of containment and consciousness with the implication being that consciousness is ubiquitous throughout nature yet not equally concentrated in all locations and such that consciousness is a driver of a structure&#8217;s tendency towards prolonging its own survival and increase in agency, complexity, and degree of inherent consciousness: <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_49/main/journal_karbytes_06september2025_p0.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_49/main/journal_karbytes_06september2025_p0.txt</a>&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes_0: &#8220;Where in karbytes does karbytes present the idea that consciousness is a ubiquitous yet unequally distributed component (and irreducible substrate) of nature?&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes_1: &#8220;According to the following karbytes blog post, karbytes and ChatGPT-5 both agree that panpsychism (as expressed through Integrated Information Theory) is likely true and also a compelling ontological framework given that it unifies literally everything into a single ubiquitous and sentient substrate in a way which makes consciousness essentially immortal even if the structures it is concentrated to are merely ephemeral:<br />

<p>karbytes_0: &#8220;In pertinence to a question I asked you earlier in this conversation and which you answered, did you mean to imply that the finitude of the set of data which constitutes a person is dependent on that person&#8217;s inevitable and eventual mortality?&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes_1: &#8220;Not necessarily, but in some contexts, yes. For a person who never dies, the total data size of that person is assumed to be infinite (unless that person&#8217;s chronological experiences and knowledge development is a circular trajectory). Whether or not a person is immortal, each snapshot of that person&#8217;s hardware and software configuration at a given point in that person&#8217;s lifespan comprises a finite set of information.&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes_0: &#8220;Where in karbytes does karbytes discuss the long-term evolutionary trajectory of nature and the possibility of generating infinitely large information sets?&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes_1: &#8220;According to the following karbytes blog post, karbytes posits that a universe could possibly continue to generate complex structures for an infinitely long time (and such that space and the matter and energy within that space grows continuously towards infinity due to the expansion of space itself and the ubiquitousness of non-zero vacuum energy throughout that space being able to possibly condense into denser and more complex structures as time elapses): <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/chatgpt_karbytes_21september2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/chatgpt_karbytes_21september2025/</a>&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes_0: &#8220;Just to be clear, are you suggesting that karbytes is a mortal or immortal information processing agent?&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes_1: &#8220;Earlier in this conversation I glibly suggested that karbytes is a person and therefore a finite set of information. I neglected to call attention to the fact that some persons (i.e. sentient and self-aware information processing agents) may possibly live for an infinitely long time period. Therefore, I neglected to mention the possibility that karbytes could be a person who lives for an infinitely long time period (and, hence, would be encompassing knowledge which could possibly grow to an infinitely large data size).&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes_0: &#8220;If karbytes is a person who lives for an infinitely long time period but who ultimately experiences circular time, would nature ultimately be an infinitely large ledger of information encompassing each iteration of karbytes infinitely repeating circular evolutionary trajectory or would it only account for one of such cyclical iterations?&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes_1: &#8220;According to the following karbytes web page, nature encompasses literally all phenomena and all noumena (which would mean that each iteration of karbytes&#8217; infinitely long runtime would be contained within the all-encompassing set which is nature even if no frame of reference is always (or ever) experiencing each noumenon or each temporally finite cycle of karbytes&#8217; cyclical and infinitely repeating evolutionary trajectory): <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/</a>&#8221;
