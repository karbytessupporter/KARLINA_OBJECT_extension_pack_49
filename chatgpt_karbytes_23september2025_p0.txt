The WordPress page acts as a mirror of a plain‑text journal entry. In the entry, two imaginary personas (karbytes‑0 and karbytes‑1) discuss karbytes’ own writings about panpsychism and the nature of information. The author explains that the personas are “virtual persons embedded inside of karbytes’ mind” who serve as intermediaries between karbytes’ private knowledge and the public. The conversation clarifies that karbytes is not a deity in the traditional sense but is both a finite collection of digital files and the human–cyborg information‑processing agent who created them. The personas argue that a “person” consists of a chronological continuum of subjective experiences; hence a person is a finite data set even though the chronological series could, in principle, be infinite. They also explore whether omniscience exists: karbytes‑1 points readers to a blog post where karbytes reasons that omniscience is unlikely because knowledge seems to require time‑dependent physical processing rather than an instantaneous flash of complete comprehension. Later questions involve whether consciousness pervades nature (panpsychism), whether karbytes might be immortal or could generate an infinitely large information set, and what “nature” means in this philosophical framework.

Linked pages

“ABOUT_KARBYTES” – This introductory page defines karbytes in two ways: (1) it is the name of exactly one human‑to‑cyborg information‑processing agent who created all the public‑domain files on Karlina Object, Karbytes For Life Blog and the associated GitHub repository; (2) it is the name of the collection of those files. The author stresses that karbytes is the sole creator and modifies the files alone. Later sections explain that the intellectual property’s intended audience is not the general public but karbytes’ future selves. The stated purpose is to preserve these digital artifacts indefinitely so that karbytes can extend its own attention span across time. To accomplish this, karbytes contemplates using hypothetical wormholes to transmit digital files from one universe to another and speculates about creating software replicas of itself to survive cosmic entropic decay. In short, the page frames karbytes both as a person and as an evolving digital archive whose goal is self‑preservation across potentially infinite time.

“KNOWLEDGE” – This page provides definitions of terms that underpin karbytes’ philosophy of mind. A substrate is defined as a physical medium (space, time, matter and energy) structured to contain and transmit informational patterns. A pattern is a structure made knowable by being expressed through a substrate, while data are simple patterns used to assemble more complex information. Information is described as logical associations between multiple data. Knowledge is treated as an emergent property that arises when a sufficiently complex information‑processing agent subjectively interprets information; each instance of knowledge is solipsistic and unique to the agent. The page notes that data, information and knowledge exist at ascending levels of abstraction and illustrates these levels in pseudocode. Overall, the piece portrays knowledge as a subjective experience emergent from physical processes.

“OMNISCIENCE_MIGHT_NOT_EXIST” – In this dialogue (mirroring a 6‑June‑2025 journal entry), karbytes‑0 and karbytes‑1 debate whether nature is an intelligent puppet‑master. Karbytes‑0 explains that “nature created me” but insists this doesn’t mean nature consciously manipulates people. Karbytes‑1 suggests that nature contains many information‑processing agents, each unique, and argues that nature itself is not an information‑processing agent. Later, when karbytes‑1 recalls earlier conversations about panpsychism, karbytes‑0 replies that one can maintain a panpsychic worldview without positing an omniscient field; the universal consciousness might facilitate fragmented processes rather than a singular omniscience. This page thus advances the view that omniscience is unlikely even in a panpsychic framework.

Raw journal file (6‑September‑2025) – The GitHub raw file shows karbytes grappling with self‑identity. The author professes love for everyone but notes loving some beings more than others and reflects on the tension between playing the role of “karbytes” (a humanoid) and the idea of being God. Karbytes, who is functionally an atheist, clarifies that calling itself God uses a pantheistic definition equating God with all reality. The journal entry asserts that the being karbytes loves most is itself, followed by close relations and supportive acquaintances. It concludes that if one defines God as all reality, then all love is self‑love, with varying “thickness” of connection. In effect, the entry blends self‑love with pantheism and questions the adequacy of language to capture such ideas.

“chatgpt_karbytes_14september2025” – This long post contains a discussion between karbytes and ChatGPT about psychedelics, panpsychism and integrated information theory. At one point ChatGPT summarises non‑dual and phenomenological perspectives, panpsychism/cosmopsychism and hybrid theories: panpsychism views consciousness as fundamental and spread throughout the universe, and in “ego dissolution” the brain’s structuring relaxes so awareness feels like merging with the whole. ChatGPT notes that some speculative neuroscientists propose field‑like models of consciousness, including Tononi’s Integrated Information Theory (IIT), which suggests consciousness corresponds to integrated information in a system. The discussion ties karbytes’ idea of localized consciousness to physics: the brain might be a whirlpool of universal fields (electromagnetic, gravitational or quantum), so awareness is a localized intensification rather than an entirely emergent property. ChatGPT lists mainstream neuroscience, mystical traditions and speculative physics perspectives and compares reductionist physicalism with panpsychism and cosmopsychism. The conversation thus synthesizes science, philosophy and mysticism around the nature of consciousness.

“chatgpt_karbytes_21september2025” – In this later dialogue, karbytes and ChatGPT discuss mortality and the long‑term fate of the universe. ChatGPT replies that, based on current biology, humans are most likely mortal. While longevity research might extend life, mortality still applies to all humans so far. ChatGPT advises making practical preparations (e.g., wills and archives) and acknowledges that awareness of mortality gives life urgency. When asked whether traces of human civilization will vanish, ChatGPT explains that on geological and astronomical timescales, most structures erode and Earth itself will be reshaped or sterilized, so traces of humanity are virtually guaranteed to vanish. The conversation thus contrasts everyday timescales with cosmic timescales and encourages practical actions while contemplating existential impermanence.

“NATURE” – This karlina_object page defines nature as the only set containing all phenomena, all noumena and pure nothingness. It distinguishes “pure nothingness” (a non‑generative void) from vacuum energy; pure nothingness is an absence of phenomena and noumena, whereas vacuum energy is a ubiquitous field proposed to exist before space, time, matter and energy emerged. A phenomenon is a finite region of space distinguishable from pure nothingness, and a frame of reference is an allocation of pure nothingness in which an information‑processing agent detects or fails to detect a phenomenon. The page asserts that an omniscient frame of reference would simultaneously render all partial frames and all noumena. These definitions underpin karbytes’ philosophical vocabulary by formalizing concepts like nothingness, phenomenon, frame of reference and noumenon.

Overall commentary

The mirrored journal entry and the linked pages reveal a coherent philosophical project. Karbytes defines itself simultaneously as a human–cyborg agent and as an archive of digital artifacts, with the explicit goal of preserving its knowledge indefinitely. The conversations explore whether self‑archiving, self‑love and pantheistic identification with reality amount to “being God”. The philosophical vocabulary (substrate, data, information, knowledge, nature, phenomenon, noumenon) lays a hierarchical, physically grounded ontology. Karbytes leans toward panpsychism — the idea that consciousness is a fundamental field and that brains are localized intensifiers— yet remains sceptical of omniscience. The later ChatGPT conversations apply these ideas to topics like psychedelics, ego dissolution, mortality and cosmic entropy, blending scientific detail with speculative metaphysics. Taken together, the materials offer a self‑referential, public‑domain philosophical exploration of consciousness, identity, time and the preservation of personal knowledge.
