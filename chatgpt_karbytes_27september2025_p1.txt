Description of the karbytes_ontology page and linked pages
karbytes_ontology (27 September 2025)
This page is part of KARBYTES_FOR_LIFE_BLOG, a WordPress site created by karbytes (Karlina Ray Beringer) to archive metaphysical ideas, technical notes and software. The karbytes_ontology page presents the author’s ontological assumptions and defines several core philosophical terms. The opening paragraph explains that the list of terms outlines karbytes’ ontological framework—“a set of assumptions about what ultimately constitutes reality and how it behaves”
karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com
. The page directs readers to a companion page containing the author’s primary values
karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com
 and notes that the current document is an updated version of an archived edition
karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com
.

Content summary
Solipsism – The page defines solipsism as the “inevitable condition of any frame of reference being aware only of what it contains.” A frame of reference (denoted R) is only aware of the qualia it renders at each moment, so R(t) represents the qualia at time t and the sum of all R(t) events constitutes the agent’s timeline
karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com
.

Selfishness – The author describes selfishness as the tendency for any information‑processing agent to focus only on the phenomena occurring within its own solipsistic awareness. Such agents make decisions and evaluate sensory or computational feedback solely in terms of their own goals
karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com
. The page emphasizes that an agent cannot implement altruistic behavior that does not ultimately support its own goal‑pursuit
karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com
.

Hedonism – Hedonism is defined as the general tendency of a sentient information‑processing agent to avoid pain and attempt to experience pleasure
karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com
.

Determinism – Determinism is described as the tendency for the qualia an agent observes to follow predictable, recurrent patterns
karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com
. Later the author clarifies that determinism is the causal relationship between successive events, while indeterminism refers to events without a prior cause
karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com
.

Laws of physics and mathematics – The page treats the laws of physics as assumptions about how discrete allocations of matter and energy interact and evolve over time
karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com
. Mathematics is portrayed as a set of immutable logical rules about numbers; for example, “1 = 1” and “1 = 2 – 1” are always true
karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com
.

Metadata – The page states that it was last updated on 27 September 2025 and that its content is licensed as public domain

Links from this page
The karbytes_ontology page links to several other pages. Each linked page is summarized below.

karbytes_primary_values (25 September 2025)
The companion page lists the author’s current core values. It explains that the values are ranked by importance to karbytes
karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com
:

Nature – defined as the single, all‑encompassing set containing all phenomena, all noumena, pure non‑generative nothingness and pure generative nothingness
karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com
.

Consciousness – the capacity for an allocation of nature to render subjective qualia (sensory data or abstract thoughts)
karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com
. Consciousness can vary in how much and what types of qualia a particular information‑processing agent or frame of reference renders
karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com
.

Logic – described as components of nature interacting consistently and rule‑based, especially regarding abstract entities such as symbols and quantities
karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com
.

Comfort – the perception of pleasure being more prominent than pain and the minimization of pain
karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com
.

This page notes that it is an updated version of an archived edition and is also licensed as public domain
karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com
.

karbytes_primary_values_13june2025 (archived version)
An older version of the values page preserves karbytes’ priorities as of 13 June 2025. It lists five values:

Truth – defined as reality itself; “the way everything is actually configured”
karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com
.

Autonomy – the capacity of an information‑processing agent to set and achieve its own goals
karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com
.

Innovation – a system’s ability to change in novel ways that enable it or its agents to achieve their goals
karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com
.

Comfort – similar to the updated page, described as experiencing tolerable pain while still feeling pleasure
karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com
.

Kindness – behavior aimed at maximizing the comfort of all sentient agents
karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com
.

The archive notes that it was taken from the 13 June 2025 version of the primary values page and is also public‑domain content
karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com
.

karbytes_ontology_02september2025 (archived ontology)
This archived page captures the ontological definitions as they appeared on 2 September 2025. It repeats some definitions and adds further detail:

Hedonism is described as the propensity of sufficiently complex information‑processing agents to minimize suffering and maximize pleasure
karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com
. The author notes that hedonism is the basic heuristic guiding sentient beings’ priorities
karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com
.

Compatibilism – defined as the worldview that free will (agency) is an emergent property of deterministic factors. Free will exists only within an agent’s mental model and is partly illusory
karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com
. The degree of free will depends on the agent’s internal hardware, software and environment
karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com
. The page even proposes a formula for an agent’s degree of agency based on the number of options it can imagine and its cumulative goal‑attainment success rate
karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com
.

Mathematics – described as abstract logical relationships between numbers that are universally true throughout all of space, time, matter, energy and even nothingness
karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com
. Mathematics also describes physical reality through laws that model patterns in empirical data
karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com
.

The page again notes the last update date (27 September 2025) and public‑domain status
karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com
.

karbytes_ontology_31july2025 (older archived ontology)
The 31 July 2025 version of karbytes_ontology includes additional definitions and commentary not present in the latest version:

Nihilism – defined as the belief that purpose and ethics are arbitrary processes generated by “sufficiently complex” information‑processing agents. They are not immutable properties of nature
karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com
. The author contrasts this with mathematical rules relating numbers, which he regards as immutable
karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com
. The page states that karbytes holds a nihilistic worldview
karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com
.

Solipsism – elaborated on at length. The page describes solipsism as the belief that the only knowledge available to any agent is the information rendered by its own hardware/software
karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com
. Karbytes identifies as a “relative solipsist,” acknowledging that phenomena may exist outside his awareness but adopting an indifferent attitude toward unexperienced phenomena
karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com
. The page explains that only current experiences, memories or abstract thoughts are relevant
karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com
.

Compatibilism vs. Determinism – The author argues that free will is an emergent property of deterministic processes
karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com
. He distinguishes between “hard determinism” (no free will) and compatibilism and asserts that self‑aware agents experience relative free will because of informational incompleteness
karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com
.

This page also links to the_cosmos_as_fundamentally_digital, a separate article exploring digital physics
karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com
.

the_cosmos_as_fundamentally_digital (31 July 2025 entry)
Linked from the 31 July 2025 ontology, this extensive page contains a transcript of a conversation between karbytes and ChatGPT‑4o about the hypothesis that reality is fundamentally digital. Key points include:

The conversation occurred between 29 July and 30 July 2025
karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com
.

Karbytes proposes that all physical phenomena are reducible to discrete digital units and occur within a substrate of finite spatial dimensions but infinite temporal duration
karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com
.

ChatGPT summarises the idea of a “fundamentally digital” universe and relates it to existing frameworks such as digital physics, loop quantum gravity, cellular automaton universes and information‑theoretic physics
karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com
.

The discussion notes that if reality is digital, infinity and continuity might be approximations rather than literal physical features
karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com
. ChatGPT suggests potential consequences: a finite state universe, modified path integrals in quantum mechanics, and viewing consciousness as patterns in a discrete information substrate
karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com
.

Karbytes clarifies that the conversation is linked back to the karbytes_ontology page
karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com
, highlighting the relationship between the ontological assumptions and the digital‑cosmos hypothesis.
