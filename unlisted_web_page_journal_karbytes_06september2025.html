<p>* * *</p>
<p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>
<p>I prefer to minimize every person&#8217;s suffering and to maximize every person&#8217;s happiness.</p>
<p>In order for me to exemplify that ideal (i.e. live as though I sincerely want what I said I wanted in the previous sentence), I think it is necessary for me to forgive all transgressions to the fullest extent possible (whether those transgressions occur in the past, present, or future of any timeline). In simple terms, what I am saying I ought to do is avoid holding grudges and conjuring up resentment towards any persons (which is naturally difficult for a human to do (but I think it is possible for a human to overcome many human innate and acquired limitations through technological enhancement and other forms of biohacking such as training oneself to hold a particular worldview)).</p>
<p>I have human emotions and am quite similar to every other human at this time, but I idealize becoming a being which overcomes human tendencies to be self-destructive and destructive towards other humans (and towards other sentient beings).</p>
<p>Throughout the corpus of public Internet-hosted files named karbytes there are expressions of my relatively immature thought and emotive processes which are preserved for historical integrity. I hope that I am finally done creating more of such relatively immature content (especially since such content no longer accurately reflects my current worldview).</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />
karbytes</p>
