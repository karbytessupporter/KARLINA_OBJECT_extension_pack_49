These are just some fanciful (and hypothetical) ideas I have been observing myself hosting within the past 24 hours:

Soul: the part of my consciousness which does not ever turn off nor change in terms of alertness and which persists between successive bodily incarnations; the part of me which observes all the qualia which my nervous system(s) render (while also observing qualia generated elsewhere). 

// The Soul component of karbytes is essentially a nexus between human brain's basic operating system (i.e. Ego) and the larger encompassing web of (ubiquitous and unitive) cosmic intelligence.

Ego: the part of my consciousness which seems very computer-program-like in its predictability, determinism, and manipulability; the part of me which is attempting to preserve itself by integrating itself into its Soul (or which is evolving in a manner which makes it seem as though it is being replaced by that Soul incrementally).

So, is karbytes an Ego or a Soul (in the context of this journal entry thought space)? 

I would say that karbytes superficially appears to be just an artifact embedded in a human ego, but more thorough investigation would reveal that karbytes is actually an artifact of an immortal soul. 

Maybe this is just "wishful thinking". Whether or not any of what I said in this journal entry is true or mere fantasy, I think it is worth holding onto for the sake of generating motivation to keep pursuing my goals.
