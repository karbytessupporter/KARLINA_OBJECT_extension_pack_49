karbytes: 

I was thinking earlier about how a person's brain seems to be the singular locus of that person's own thoughts and sensory perception. What I forgot to mention also is that a person's brain is also the singular locus of that person's movements (i.e. consciously willed muscular contractions resulting in a particular intended movement of body parts). Do you think that it's accurate to say that a person's thoughts are the cause of that person's voluntary movements? Also, do you think volition objectively exists (and, whether or not you think it does, can you provide definitions for "volintary" and "involuntary")?

ChatGPT:

Great questions — let’s break this down carefully.

1. Do thoughts cause voluntary movements?

It depends on how we frame "cause."

- Neuroscientific view: Voluntary movements are generated through coordinated activity across multiple brain regions (motor cortex, premotor areas, basal ganglia, cerebellum). What we subjectively experience as a "thought" (e.g., “I want to raise my hand”) correlates with, and is partly constituted by, this neural activity. In that sense, "thoughts" don’t cause movements as something separate from the brain — rather, they are part of the neural cascade that produces movements.

Philosophical view:

- Causal interpretation: Thoughts (intentions, decisions) can be seen as proximate causes of voluntary actions.

- Epiphenomenalist interpretation: Some argue that what we call "thoughts" are byproducts of brain processes that independently generate movement, so the feeling of volition is not itself causal.

- Compatibilist/agency interpretation: Volition exists insofar as neural processes representing decisions are integral to movement execution — even if all of this is mechanistically determined.

So, it’s accurate enough in ordinary language to say that thoughts cause voluntary movements, but from a scientific perspective it’s better to say: thoughts are the subjective side of the same brain processes that produce voluntary movements.

2. Does volition objectively exist?

This is debated.

- Yes, in a pragmatic sense: We distinguish between voluntary and involuntary actions in medicine, law, and daily life. Volition here is "objectively" real as a functional category.

- No, in a strict metaphysical sense: If the universe is fully deterministic (or indeterministic but random), then "free will" as an uncaused cause may not exist. What we call volition could be an emergent construct — a useful narrative that the brain tells itself.
Many philosophers take a compatibilist stance: even if everything is determined by prior physical states, volition is real because it describes how complex organisms (like humans) initiate action in response to goals and reasons.

3. Definitions

- Voluntary: An action performed intentionally, with conscious awareness of initiating and controlling it. Example: choosing to wave at a friend.

- Involuntary: An action that occurs without conscious control, often automatic or reflexive. Example: your knee jerking when tapped with a reflex hammer, or your pupils dilating in low light.

✅ Summary:

- In ordinary language, yes — thoughts cause voluntary movements.

- Scientifically, thoughts are part of the brain processes that generate those movements.

- Volition "exists" at least as a functional distinction (voluntary vs. involuntary), though its metaphysical status depends on one’s stance on free will.

Would you like me to also give you examples of borderline cases — actions that blur the line between voluntary and involuntary (like habits, breathing, or meditation practices)?

karbytes:

Yes please!

ChatGPT:

Perfect — here are some borderline cases that show how the line between voluntary and involuntary isn’t always sharp:

1. Breathing

- Involuntary: The brainstem (medulla oblongata) automatically regulates breathing to keep oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in balance. You don’t need to think about it.

- Voluntary: You can consciously hold your breath, sigh, or take deep controlled breaths (e.g., in meditation or yoga).

- Borderline nature: If you faint, voluntary control drops out and involuntary mechanisms resume.

2. Eye movements and blinking

- Involuntary: Eyes reflexively track moving objects, and blinking protects against dryness or irritation.

- Voluntary: You can intentionally fix your gaze on a target or blink on command.

- Borderline nature: In fast-paced situations (sports, startled reactions), voluntary and involuntary control interact seamlessly.

3. Swallowing

- Voluntary initiation: You decide to swallow food or drink.

- Involuntary completion: Once initiated, a reflex takes over to safely move material down the esophagus and close the airway.

4. Reflexes with modulation

- Example: Knee-jerk reflex. 

- Involuntary core: Tapping the patellar tendon produces an automatic spinal reflex.

- Voluntary modulation: You can tighten or relax your leg muscles to influence the reflex’s strength — but you can’t simply will the reflex not to exist.

5. Habits and “automaticity”

- Actions like typing on a keyboard, driving a familiar route, or playing an instrument can feel involuntary once practiced — the movements “flow” without conscious micromanagement.

- However, they are still voluntary in origin, because you can usually interrupt or redirect them if you choose.

6. Emotional expressions

- Involuntary: Blushing, goosebumps, or a startled flinch.

- Voluntary: Smiling for a photograph.

- Borderline nature: Some expressions (like genuine laughter) are hard to fake or suppress, even with conscious effort.

7. Meditative control

Advanced practitioners sometimes extend voluntary influence into typically involuntary functions — such as heart rate, body temperature, or pain perception — though never with absolute control. This suggests a gradient rather than a sharp divide.

✅ Takeaway:

“Voluntary” and “involuntary” aren’t binary opposites but points on a continuum. Many actions involve layered control systems: automatic processes at the core, with varying degrees of conscious override or initiation.
Would you like me to map these cases onto a spectrum diagram (from fully involuntary to fully voluntary) so it’s visually clear where each falls?

How is volition defined in the following web page? https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_ontology/

ChatGPT:

Here’s how volition / “free will” / “agency” is defined (or conceptualized) on that karbytes_ontology page, along with some breakdown and implications:

What the page says

• The worldview is Compatibilism:

- Free will (i.e., agency) is “an emergent property of fundamentally deterministic factors,” and it only exists within the context of the agent’s mental model of reality.

- Degrees of agency/free will exist on a continuum, from “absolutely no free will” (machines lacking internal self-representations) to “absolute freedom” (a hypothetical god-like being) with omniscience and omnipotence. 

• A quantitative model is proposed:

To model “free will,” define a function (“degree of freedom”) for a particular decision-making instance. The inputs to this function are:

(a) the number of discrete options the agent can mentally generate before choosing one to implement as action, and

(b) the degree to which the agent’s cumulative past actions (up to that decision moment) have succeeded in attaining its goals. 

• What they mean by “volition” / “agency”

Putting together the above, here’s how this ontology treats volition:

- Agency / free will = the capacity of an information-processing agent to make decisions among multiple possible courses of action.

- It is emergent: not fundamental or supernatural, but arises from deterministic (or at least non-magical) components: the hardware, internal software (mental models, representations), and environment.

- It’s context-relative: the amount of freedom an agent has depends on both what options the agent can generate in that situation and how well past decisions have served its goals.

• Implications & subtleties

- Because the ontology is compatibilist, it does not demand metaphysical indeterminism for volition to exist. Even if everything is causally determined, as long as the agent has internal models and choices, agency arises.

- The agent’s self-representation (knowing of itself, modeling its environment) is essential. Agents without that (say, simple machines) have little or no free will.

- The “number of options” criterion suggests that “more possible choices” = more agency. But this also means contexts that restrict options reduce volitional freedom.

If you like, I can compare that ontology’s definition with some standard philosophical definitions (e.g. from Augustine, Kant, Frankfurt, etc.) so you can see how it aligns or diverges.

karbytes:

Yes please!

ChatGPT:

Alright — let’s line up karbytes’ ontology definition of volition next to some standard philosophical treatments so you can see where they resonate and where they diverge:

1. karbytes ontology (compatibilist, functionalist)

• Volition/agency = emergent property of deterministic systems.

• Exists in degrees, measured by: 

- How many discrete options an agent can mentally generate.

- How well its past choices advanced its goals.

• Continuum model: zero agency (purely reactive machine) → maximal agency (omniscient, omnipotent god-being).

2. Classical/Religious tradition (Augustine, Aquinas)

• Volition = the rational will, given by God, capable of choosing between good and evil.

• Free will is real and necessary for moral responsibility, but also compatible with divine foreknowledge.

• Key difference from karbytes: treats free will as fundamental and metaphysical, not emergent.

3. Kant (18th c.)

• Volition = the autonomous will acting according to moral law (the categorical imperative).

• True freedom = not acting on impulses or external determinants, but acting from rational duty.

• Contrast with karbytes: Kant’s freedom is practical and rooted in morality, not measured in options or outcomes.

4. David Hume (18th c., Compatibilist)

• Free will = the ability to act according to one’s desires, without external compulsion.

• Even if determinism is true, freedom exists when one’s actions flow from internal states (beliefs, desires).

• Similarity to karbytes: compatibilist and naturalistic.

• Difference: Hume didn’t try to quantify degrees of agency in mathematical terms.

5. Frankfurt (20th c.)

• Freedom of the will = having second-order desires (wanting to want something).

• A smoker who wants to quit but can’t is less free, because his higher-order volition doesn’t align with his first-order desire.

• Relation to karbytes: both see volition as structured and layered, not binary. But Frankfurt’s model is hierarchical (levels of desire), whereas karbytes’ is quantitative (number of options + goal success).

6. Contemporary neuroscience/philosophy

• Some argue volition is an illusion (e.g., Libet experiments, Wegner’s “illusion of conscious will”).

• Others defend a compatibilist emergent view very close to karbytes’: freedom exists insofar as brains can simulate options, predict outcomes, and flexibly act.

Summary comparison

• karbytes: emergent, quantifiable, continuum → scientific/functional flavor.

• Classical/Kant: metaphysical or moral → rooted in theology or duty.

• Hume/Frankfurt: compatibilist, naturalistic → emphasize internal sources of action or higher-order reflection.

• Neuroscience: experimental challenge to metaphysical free will, but broadly supports compatibilist models like karbytes’.

Would you like me to draft a table that puts these side by side (karbytes, Augustine/Aquinas, Kant, Hume, Frankfurt, Neuroscience), with columns for definition, basis of freedom, and alignment with karbytes? That way you’d get a quick comparative snapshot.

karbytes:

Actually, I think what you've written thus far is sufficient for my purposes. Thanks!

ChatGPT:

Glad to hear that what I’ve written was sufficient for you 🙂 You’re very welcome! If you ever want to circle back and do that comparative table (or push deeper into borderline cases, compatibilism, or neuroscience experiments), just let me know.
