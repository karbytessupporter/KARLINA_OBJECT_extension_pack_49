Metaphorically speaking, a "rat" is any piece of information which enters my blog which ultimately ends up being what I consider to be excessively sensationalist
or logically or syntactically sloppy for me to classify as professional quality. A "rat" enters my blog because I initially think it's a climactic epiphany offering permanent closure to some unresolved issue in my mind. So far I have not counted any "rats" entering KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_49. Perhaps this file is a "rat"; a pollutant more than a value-increasing asset.

When I conceived of my top personal values (which are currently defined in the following web page), I thought of INNOVATION as essentially being creative and (eventually) effective problem solving.

Suppose I get to a point in my existence where I seem to have attained permanent residence in metaphysical utopia (whose specifications are outlined in the following web page).

Then I could say that the only "problems" I would have left to solve are essentially in the context of playing some kind of video-game-like "game" which solves the problem of me apparently always wanting or needing some problem to solve. The "solution" I propose is not necessarily the annihilation of desire nor of conscious existence (especially as an egocentric goal-oriented information processing system). Instead, the solution I propose is inhabiting a game of my own making which has (ultimately harmless) in-game challenges to overcome and localized, temporary, and strategically selective amnesia (and some if not all of the specifications of that game and idealized reality are discussed in the following web page).

In my lived pragmatic experience (and not just my abstract or idealistic fantasies), I frequently (if not always) contend with the fear of being cut off from something I need or want whether it's a process or a material or informational resource that gives me COMFORT (which I assume I would feel suicidally depressed and maybe in unbearable physical agony without).
