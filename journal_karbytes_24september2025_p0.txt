This morning I had two vivid dreams which seemed to be in the context of me doing some kind of homework assignement for school (at college level). The first of those dreams involved me writing some kind of poem outside which was something about describing oppression as a force which is invisible but whose effects are not and then my teacher (some lady with blonde or amber hair and fair skin) told me it was time for the class to continue with that assignment in the library (and I assumed that we would be in the library for about an hour before we would have to leave). I left the poem part of my paper outside (and assumed it would be there when I came back to it) and decided that I would use the time in the library to write the second more prose-heavy part of that paper which my teacher seemed to want which sounded less like whining about oppression and more about coming up with practical solutions to problems. I started thinking about outlining the solutions as me joining a committee which helps people access affordable and eco-friendly housing (given that I really think having a dignified place to call home is central to what I consider to be social injustice issues at this time for my species). While in the library I sought to get some free hot coffee from the cafeteria part where beverages are dispensed from what looks like soda machines. I was also scanning for a place to sit down which was a corner of a long table with electrical outlets on it and which did not make me feel too claustraphobic. The dream faded and I was in another dream which looked like the room I've been sleeping in. I was supposed to do some kind of electrical lab and put approximately fourteen metal spoons inside of a pot partially filled with water (enough to submerge the spoons) and I plugged the pot into an electrical outlet and was scared about the effects. The other electronics showed signs that they might have been overloaded with electricity or else where signaling that something was wrong with the outlet. My laptop indicator light (which is orange while charging and white when fully charged) turned from orange to purple and another item which was plugged in on a table (which resembled some kind of pan on a stove top) temporarily erupted with flames. Meanwhile, the pot filled with water and spoons started spinning rapidly and the water glowed bright purple and evaporated within a minute. At that point I was afraid to go near the pot because I feared electrocution or spontaneous explosions but reasoned I had to unplug the pot and avoid touching the spoons until they cooled off. I woke up from that dream in the same room as that dream was taking place in and slowly came to my senses that I had no such homework assignments, but rather, a life with very few obligations. I did get my first paycheck from [employment_situation] deposited today in my bank account and saw that it was approximately $300.
