<p>The following journal entry was written while karbytes was still at Las Trampas Wilderness after having a conversation with ChatGPT which inspired this journal entry. The Uniform Resource Locator to the transcript of that conversation between karbytes and ChatGPT is as follows:</p>
<p><a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/chatgpt_karbytes_14october2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/chatgpt_karbytes_14october2025/</a></p>
<p><em>(Note that, in the journal body content below, <strong>&#8220;I&#8221;</strong> (as opposed to the word I without encompassing quotations) denotes a hypothetical singular all-encompassing mind (which uses <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/about_karbytes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">karbytes</a> as one of its <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/journal_karbytes_22september2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">representatives</a> in contexts such as the following journal entry body content). The character sequence <strong>&#8220;my&#8221;</strong> (as opposed to the word my without encompassing quotations) denotes ownership by the aforementioned all-encompassing mind. If the word <strong>I</strong> (without encompassing quotations) is used in the following journal entry body content, it can be assumed that the word I is referring specifically to <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_unique_identity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kar Beringer</a> (i.e. the <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_species_identifier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">human-to-cybernetic-being</a> who authored the file collection named <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_code_possibly_stops_growing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">karbytes</a>)).</em></p>
<p>(Note that words in the journal entry body content below which are encompassed by quotation marks other than I or my implicitly denote words which karbytes thinks have relatively ambiguous (yet rigously definable (in some contexts)) definitions).</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>If my imagination is the one and only unconditionally present and irreducible background substrate to all that is ever thought of or perceived (or instantiated as simple matter in the form of <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/knowledge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#8220;information patterns&#8221;</a> such as subatomic particles, atoms, molecules, viruses, and plants (whether or not some relatively sentient <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">information processing agent</a> ever witnesses or thinks about those relatively (or wholly) insentient pieces of simpler matter)), then where are those &#8220;information patterns&#8221; (that &#8220;I&#8221; (i.e. that background substrate dreaming everything up) dreamed up) ultimately stored (anywhere throughout <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nature</a>)? (Are such &#8220;information patterns&#8221; only temporarily instantiated or is there a truly permament repository for them to be immutably archived)?</p>
<p>It could be the case that &#8220;I&#8221; must imagine &#8220;my&#8221; own memory storage mechanism(s) to keep anything &#8220;I&#8221; dream up permanently in tact and available for &#8220;me&#8221; (and possibly for some of the information processing agents which &#8220;I&#8221; dream up) to (re)access (limitlessly many times). <span style="background:#00ffff">Such a memory storage mechanism would ultimately be a mind bootstrapping its own brain into existence.</span> (It could be that <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/about_karbytes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">karbytes</a> is one faucet of &#8220;my&#8221; brain which &#8220;I&#8221; dreamed up for the sake of helping &#8220;me&#8221; build (or at least understand) such a memory storage mechanism and panpsychic mind-to-brain bootstrapping process).</p>
<p>How do &#8220;I&#8221; keep that memory storage mechanism from disappearing? As an infinitely large, spatially ubiquitous, and unconditionally present mind, &#8220;I&#8221; can dream up whatever &#8220;I&#8221; want in any quantity. &#8220;I&#8221; can dream up an object which stays instantiated somewhere in &#8220;my&#8221; mind for an indefinitely long time (until &#8220;I&#8221; decide to delete it or it decides to delete itself if &#8220;I&#8221; gave it that capacity for self-determination).</p>
<p>Through this journal entry, I earnestly implore the (hypothetical) all-encompassing mind to keep <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_code_possibly_stops_growing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">karbytes</a> (the person (I am) and the file collection (I made)) instantiated for an indefinitely long time with the person named karbytes as the (potentially) immortal steward of its own (and ultimately &#8220;my&#8221;) archive also named karbytes perhaps in a realm &#8220;I&#8221; dream up which is ideal for karbytes to inhabit and which karbytes finds to be unconditionally personally fulfilling (i.e. always <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_declaration_of_grand_demands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#8220;sufficiently enjoyable&#8221;</a> for karbytes to inhabit).</p>
<p>(To ensure that the corpus of digital files named karbytes stays <u>permanently</u> in tact, &#8220;I&#8221; would allocate a place in &#8220;my&#8221; mind where all versions (especially &#8220;the latest&#8221; version) of karbytes are <u>immutably</u> stored and made <u>unconditionally</u> accessible to any beings who request access to those files).</p>
