<p><span style="background: #ffff00">The following terms and their respective definitions describe <strong>nature</strong> (i.e. the whole of reality (i.e. all that exists)) as being the only set which contains all phenomena, all noumena, and all of pure nothingness.</span></p>
<p><em>To view hidden text inside of the preformatted text box below, scroll horizontally.</em></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>PURE_NOTHINGNESS:</strong> (synonyms: absolute nothingness, non-generative void) a complete absence of both phenomena and noumena; a &#8220;field&#8221; of non-existence which exists everywhere and nowhere simultaneously without being logically inconsistent.</p>
<p><em>Note that &#8220;pure nothingness&#8221; is not the same thing as what is proposed to be the eternally present and ubiquitous &#8220;field&#8221; comprised of <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/learning_about_vacuum_energy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vacuum energy</a> and, unlike &#8220;pure nothingness&#8221;, that field of vacuum energy is proposed to have existed before <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space" target="_blank" rel="noopener">space</a>, <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time" target="_blank" rel="noopener">time</a>, <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">matter</a>, and <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">energy</a> emerged in the universe in which this website exists (as a relatively stable and finite pattern of information contained and observed via the substrate of matter and energy).</em></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>PHENOMENON:</strong> (plural: phenomena) a finite region of space which is distinguishable from pure nothingness due to the fact that the finite region of space is perceived (by some frame of reference) as containing specific quantifiable features.</p>
<p>An example of a phenomenon is a light sensor inside of an <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">electronic</a> circuit detecting incoming <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light" target="_blank" rel="noopener">light</a> whose wavelengths are exactly 700 nanometers and not some other wavelength such as 470 nanometers.</p>
<p>A <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human" target="_blank" rel="noopener">human</a> nervous system which perceives incoming light (which enters the eyes and which causes a corresponding electrical signal to be sent across the optical nerves and to the visual processing circuits of the brain) whose wavelengths are exactly 700 nanometers consciously experiences the phenomenon of the color <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red" target="_blank" rel="noopener">red</a>.</p>
<p>The <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">qualitative</a> phenomenon referred to as the color red is distinct from the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quantitative</a> phenomenon referred to as the <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">number</a> 700.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>FRAME_OF_REFERENCE:</strong> an allocation of pure nothingness in which some <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information processing agent</a> detects the presence or the absence of a particular phenomenon.</p>
<p>A <strong>partial frame of reference</strong> experiences itself as being localized to <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;the present moment&#8221;</a> within the context of exactly one linear and perpetually forward-moving (through time) <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spacetime continuum</a>.</p>
<p>An <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omniscience" target="_blank" rel="noopener">omniscient</a> (rather than partial frame of reference) would render all partial frames of reference simultaneously and also be aware of all noumena simultaneously.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>NOUMENON:</strong> (plural: noumena) a specific phenomenon which is not being observed by some partial frame of reference.</p>
<p>Suppose that two unique partial frames of reference exist and that one of those frames of reference, A, is observing some phenomenon, X, while the other frame of reference, B, is not observing X. Then, according to B, X is a noumenon. In pseudocode that can be represented as follows:</p>
<pre>
A.is_observing(X) = true. // A experiences X as a phenomenon.
B.is_observing(X) = false. // B "experiences" X as a noumenon.
</pre>
