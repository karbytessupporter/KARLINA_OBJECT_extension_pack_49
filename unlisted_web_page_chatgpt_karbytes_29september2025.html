<p>[Thought]</p>
<p>The NATURE_09july2025 page on KARBYTES_FOR_LIFE_BLOG is essentially a lightly edited mirror of an earlier “NATURE” article from the author’s karlina_object site. After a note explaining that the body of the article comes from the 09 July 2025 version of the NATURE page, the post contains a colourful illustration of a large cube built from eight smaller cubes. The article then discusses metaphysics‑style concepts. It defines PURE NOTHINGNESS as an “absence of both phenomena and noumena”—a field of non‑existence that exists everywhere and nowhere simultaneously. The author stresses that pure nothingness is not the same as vacuum energy; vacuum energy is described as a zero‑point field that (according to some cosmological models) predates space, time, matter and energy. A PHENOMENON is defined as a finite region of space perceived as containing quantifiable features, illustrated by a light sensor detecting 700‑nm light and a human perceiving the color red. A FRAME OF REFERENCE is an allocation of pure nothingness in which an “information processing agent” detects the presence or absence of phenomena; partial frames experience a single present moment while an omniscient frame would render all partial frames simultaneously. A NOUMENON is a phenomenon that is not being observed by a given frame of reference.</p>
<p>The post links to numerous related pages:</p>
<p>* <a href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" target="_blank">karlina_object – NATURE</a> – The source of the post’s definitions. This page uses similar structure but introduces additional categories such as NONGENERATIVE VOID (an absolutely ubiquitous absence of any phenomenon or noumenon) and GENERATIVE VOID, a substrate that contains all noumena and gives rise to all phenomena; it notes that this generative void might encompass a ubiquitous field of zero‑point energy. It repeats the definitions of phenomenon, frame of reference, and noumenon and includes a short pseudocode example to show how one frame can observe something that another frame does not. Like the blog post, the page states that the content was last updated 28 September 2025 and is released to the public domain.</p>
<p>* <a href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/agency/" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" target="_blank">karlina_object – AGENCY</a> – This page explains the author’s concept of agency. Agency is described as an emergent property of a sufficiently complex information processing agent that allows it to generate a virtual model of its environment and to control which phenomena appear in its frame of reference. An information processing agent is defined as a partition of nature that consists of a finite allocation of space, time, matter and energy and that perceives, decides and acts to attain goals. The page describes how such agents learn, form goals, perceive, decide and execute actions. It also notes that the material was last updated on 10 July 2025 and is public domain.</p>
<p>* <a href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/numbers/" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" target="_blank">karlina_object – NUMBERS</a> – This mathematically oriented page defines numbers as pieces of information representing unique abstract patterns. It explains that “one” is the smallest natural number and corresponds to the length of a unit interval on a Cartesian axis, while “zero” represents the absence of a countable phenomenon and sits halfway between −1 and 1. The page discusses how numbers can have finite or infinite representations, emphasising that numbers are abstract but must be stored physically by information processing agents. Additional sections on infinity, natural numbers, integers and rational numbers provide mathematical definitions and examples. Like other pages on the site, it is part of a publicly available metaphysical/mathematical library.</p>
<p>* <a href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" target="_blank">KARBYTES_FOR_LIFE_BLOG (home page)</a> – The blog’s main landing page describes itself as an archive of the author’s social‑media posts and files. It contains a directory listing numerous pages such as software engineering portfolio, micro directory definition and karbytes ontology (each with an update timestamp). The page lists the author’s identity (Karbytes, legally Karlina Ray Beringer), birth date (13 January 1990), and contact information. It notes that every page on the site has been saved to the Wayback Machine and that the blog was established on 7 August 2022. The content is in the public domain.</p>
<p>* <a href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" target="_blank">karlina_object (home page)</a> – This companion site is described as an expression of the author’s interest in metaphysics, physics, computer science, mathematics and digital media. It links to a rich directory of pages (e.g., Knowledge, Triangle Graphing, Probability, Base Converter). The page provides similar author details and networking links and states that each page is archived and released to the public domain. The site was established on 3 April 2020.</p>
<p>In addition to these primary links, NATURE_09july2025 includes pointers to encyclopedic topics such as vacuum or zero‑point energy, space, time, matter, energy, electronics, light, human perception, qualitative/quantitative distinctions, and omniscience. These links lead to external reference pages (mostly Wikipedia) and serve to support the metaphysical definitions. The page also links to a license notice explaining that the content is public domain and to WordPress functions like “sign up” and “log in” (standard parts of the site template).

<p><strong>karbytes:</strong></p>
<p>Do you consider the latest version of the NATURE page to be scientifically accurate?</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong></p>
<p>[Thought]</p>
<p>The version of the NATURE page that we examined is a metaphysical/philosophical essay rather than a scientific explanation of the natural world. Mainstream physics and philosophy use many of the same words differently:</p>
<p>* Vacuum energy – Modern quantum theory predicts that even in an ideal vacuum, energy is not zero because particle–antiparticle pairs continuously appear and disappear. A recent overview notes that even “in the most perfect vacuum, energy persists” and that this intrinsic energy arises from quantum fluctuations. The NATURE page, however, treats “pure nothingness” as a real “field” that is distinct from vacuum energy and suggests that a “generative void” might contain zero‑point energy. These claims are speculative and go beyond what is supported by quantum field theory or cosmology.</p>
<p>* Frames of reference – In classical dynamics, a frame of reference is simply a coordinate system attached to a body that allows positions and motions to be described relative to that body; for example, latitude and longitude describe points on Earth. The NATURE page instead defines a frame of reference as an “allocation of pure nothingness” perceived by an “information processing agent.” This personal, conscious “frame” has no analogue in physics and conflates subjective experience with an objective coordinate system.</p>
<p>* Phenomena and noumena – The page’s discussion of phenomena (things observed) versus noumena (things not observed) is drawn from metaphysics (notably Kant’s philosophy) rather than empirical science. While the distinction has philosophical interest, it is not used in modern scientific methodology.</p>
<p>In short, although the NATURE page is intellectually creative, it blends personal metaphysical speculation with technical terms from physics and mathematics in ways that are not supported by scientific evidence or standard definitions. If one is looking for scientifically accurate explanations of vacuum energy, reference frames, and related concepts, it would be better to consult physics texts or reputable educational resources.</p>
<p><strong>karbytes:</strong></p>
<p>Do you think that either phenomena or noumena objectively exist?</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong></p>
<p>[Thought]</p>
<p>I don’t have personal beliefs or opinions. However, the terms “phenomena” and “noumena” come from a specific philosophical tradition and their status depends on which philosophical viewpoint one adopts.</p>
<p>In Immanuel Kant’s epistemology, there are two “worlds”: the phenomenal world and the noumenal world. The phenomenal world is the world as we experience it—it is constructed from our sensory data and shaped by innate structures of the mind. The noumenal world, by contrast, is the “thing-in-itself”—reality as it exists independently of our perceptions. Kant argues that our knowledge is always mediated by our cognitive faculties and that we can never directly know noumena. We can only be aware of their existence indirectly through the way they give rise to phenomena.</p>
<p>Other philosophers disagree with Kant. Realists, for instance, maintain that an objective external world exists and that science can in principle reveal its properties, though they wouldn’t necessarily use the term “noumenon.” Idealists and some constructivists, on the other hand, question whether anything exists beyond appearances. In modern science, the word “phenomenon” simply means an observable fact or event, and “noumenon” is rarely used. So whether phenomena or noumena “objectively exist” depends on one’s philosophical stance; there is no empirical test that can settle the question.</p>
<p><strong>karbytes:</strong></p>
<p>Do you consider numbers to be phenomena, noumena, both, or neither?</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong></p>
<p>[Thought]</p>
<p>I don’t have personal views, but I can explain how philosophers have treated numbers in relation to phenomena and noumena.</p>
<p>In Kant’s philosophy the term phenomenon refers to an object as it appears to us through the forms of intuition (space and time) and the categories of understanding, while noumenon refers to the “thing in itself” that exists independently of our perception. Numbers are not spatiotemporal or sensory objects, so they are not phenomena in the way that, say, a chair or a sunset is. Kant sometimes treats properties such as “solidity, extension, motion, number and figure” as primary qualities that belong to the thing itself. However, this does not mean numbers are noumena in any straightforward sense; rather, number is one of the concepts through which we structure experience.</p>
<p>In contemporary metaphysics numbers are usually classified as abstract objects. Philosophers tend to agree that numbers, if they exist, are abstract rather than concrete. There is disagreement about their ontological status: platonists argue that numbers and other mathematical objects have a real, mind‑independent existence, whereas nominalists deny that abstract objects exist at all. Some thinkers regard numbers as human inventions that do not exist outside of our conceptual schemes, while others think that “some of our invented abstract concepts seem to have an existence that is independent of us, like the numbers and the force of gravity”.</p>
<p>Because numbers are non‑spatial, non‑temporal and causally inert, they do not fit neatly into the categories of phenomena or noumena. Whether they “exist” independently of minds is a matter of ongoing philosophical debate rather than empirical science.</p>
<p><strong>karbytes:</strong></p>
<p>How do you think karbytes would answer that question?</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong></p>
<p>[Thought]</p>
<p>Karbytes’s website treats “number” as a special kind of phenomenon, not as something outside experience. The NUMBERS page defines a number as “a piece of information which non‑ambiguously represents exactly one of limitlessly many unique abstract patterns” and later states explicitly that numbers are “abstract phenomena” even though they are “communicated and stored using physical resources inside of and between information processing agents”. On the NATURE page, the author distinguishes between the qualitative phenomenon of perceiving the colour red and the quantitative phenomenon of the number 700; numbers are “not directly observable the way qualia are” but “exist as abstract data inside of the photonic and electronic interactions generated by computational hardware”. In karbytes’s ontology a phenomenon is any finite region of the generative void that is rendered by a frame of reference, whereas a noumenon is a phenomenon that is not being directly observed.</p>
<p>Given these definitions, karbytes would likely answer that numbers are abstract phenomena. They are phenomena because they can be represented and rendered by information‑processing agents (for example, a computer storing the number 700). However, they are abstract rather than sensory; they don’t manifest as qualia like colours or sounds. A number can be a noumenon relative to a particular frame of reference if that frame is not currently observing it, but this does not give numbers a noumenal status in themselves.</p>
<p><strong>karbytes:</strong></p>
<p>How do you think karbytes would define the terms &#8220;abstract&#8221; and &#8220;concrete&#8221;?</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong></p>
<p>[Thought]</p>
<p>Karbytes tends to draw a sharp line between higher‑level informational patterns and the lower‑level physical substrate that realizes them. On the <a href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/knowledge/" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" target="_blank">KNOWLEDGE</a> page, the author states that “the term abstract is used interchangeably with the term virtual”. Abstract entities are described as patterns of information that exist in a virtual sense; for instance, the NUMBERS page notes that numbers are “abstract phenomena” even though they are “communicated and stored using physical resources” inside of information‑processing agents. Likewise, in a journal entry about software, karbytes writes that software objects “exist only in ‘a realm’ which is abstract compared to what you and I refer to as ‘the physical realm,’” yet those same objects have a physical instantiation as binary sequences in computer hardware.</p>
<p>By contrast, karbytes uses concrete to refer to low‑level, physical processes. In the page explaining <a href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_ontology_31july2025/" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" target="_blank">karbytes’ ontology</a>, the author describes free will as an emergent property of “relatively low‑level (i.e. concrete) and deterministic processes”. This suggests that concrete phenomena are the fundamental physical events—arrangements of space, time, matter and energy—that generate higher‑level abstractions. Thus, in karbytes’ framework, abstract or virtual objects are high‑level informational patterns (like numbers or software) that depend on but transcend their physical implementation, while concrete objects are the underlying physical processes and states from which those abstractions emerge.</p>
<p><strong>karbytes:</strong></p>
<p>How does karbytes define nothingness and non-existence?</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong></p>
<p>[Thought]</p>
<p>Karbytes’ ontology distinguishes several layers of “nothingness.” The <a href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/NATURE_09july2025/" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" target="_blank">NATURE_09july2025</a> entry defines PURE NOTHINGNESS (also called a non‑generative void) as “a complete absence of both phenomena and noumena”. It describes this pure nothingness as a “field of non‑existence” that exists “everywhere and nowhere simultaneously”. This is not the same as the quantum vacuum; the page notes that vacuum energy is a real, ubiquitous field that existed before space, time, matter and energy, whereas pure nothingness lacks even that.</p>
<p>The original NATURE page uses the term NONGENERATIVE VOID for the same concept—“an absolutely ubiquitous absence of any phenomenon and also of any noumenon”. Because readers of the page are observing something, the page argues that any instance of nongenerative void is “proven to be absolutely non‑existent” from their frame of reference. Non‑existence, in this sense, is the total absence of all phenomena and noumena.</p>
<p>Karbytes contrasts this with a GENERATIVE VOID, described as an everywhere‑present substrate that “contains all noumena and … gives rise to and contains all phenomena”. The page also uses “background nothingness” for this generative void—an irreducible, featureless substrate on which all phenomena appear and which inherently contains all noumena. Thus, in karbytes’ framework, nothingness may refer either to a generative background in which things occur (background nothingness) or to a non‑generative void that is true non‑existence, the complete absence of any phenomenon or noumenon.</p>
<p><strong>karbytes:</strong></p>
<p>Is it more accurate to suggest that phenomena emerge from a GENERATIVE_VOID or from a NONGENERATIVE_VOID (with the implication being that phenomena could potentially &#8220;bootstrap themselves into existence&#8221; without any &#8220;prior cause&#8221; or &#8220;magical substrate&#8221;)?</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong></p>
<p>[At this point in the conversation, karbytes used up all of its Agent Mode quota for the month. Hence, ChatGPT-5 instead of ChatGPT Agent Mode generated the responses after this point in the conversation.]</p>
<p>[Thought]</p>
<p>Karbytes makes a clear distinction between generative and non‑generative nothingness. In their ontology the GENERATIVE_VOID is “an absolutely ubiquitous substrate which…contains all noumena and which gives rise to and contains all phenomena”. It functions as the background in which events can occur—analogous, in karbytes’ view, to an all‑pervading field (perhaps the zero‑point energy of quantum field theory). By contrast, PURE_NOTHINGNESS or NONGENERATIVE_VOID is “a complete absence of both phenomena and noumena”. Because it contains no “seeds of being,” it cannot itself produce phenomena; the NATURE page even argues that any instance of nongenerative void is “proven to be absolutely non‑existent” from the perspective of an observer.</p>
<p>Mainstream physics also treats empty space as something other than absolute nothingness. A recent explanation of the quantum vacuum notes that “even the vacuum must always crackle with fluctuations in the quantum fields that fill it,” so it has a minimum energy known as zero‑point energy. These vacuum fluctuations can give rise to transient particle–antiparticle pairs, but they occur within a pre‑existing quantum field and do not represent matter bootstrapping itself from pure non‑existence. In other words, “nothingness” in physics is a “peculiar type of nothing” that “comes dangerously close to resembling a something”.</p>
<p>Given karbytes’ definitions and the physical understanding of the vacuum, it is therefore more accurate—within their framework—to say that phenomena emerge from the generative void (a kind of ubiquitous substrate) rather than from a nongenerative void. The nongenerative void/pure nothingness is a theoretical limit in which neither noumena nor phenomena exist; by definition, it has no causal capacity. Suggesting that phenomena could “bootstrap” themselves from such a void would contradict both karbytes’ own distinction and the conventional view that even “empty” space is structured by quantum fields and energy.</p>
<p><strong>karbytes:</strong></p>
<p><span style="background:#ff6961">Perhaps karbytes should include a paragraph in the <a href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" target="_blank">NATURE</a> web page which explains how the term GENERATIVE_VOID could be replaced with the term NONEXCLUSIVE_VOID and the term NONGENERATIVE_VOID with the term EXCLUSIVE_VOID to denote the lack of implied causality between such voids and any noumena and phenomena which happen to exist (either as observed or thought objects or as potential objects).</span></p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong></p>
<p>That’s a very thoughtful suggestion! Based on the way karbytes currently uses these terms, I think it would fit well as a clarifying add-on. Right now the NATURE pages frame the distinction like this:</p>
<p>* NONGENERATIVE_VOID (pure nothingness) = an absolute absence of phenomena and noumena, a “field of non-existence”.</p>
<p>* GENERATIVE_VOID (background nothingness) = an everywhere-present substrate that contains all noumena and gives rise to all phenomena.</p>
<p>If karbytes were to add a paragraph rephrasing these with your suggested terminology, it might read something like:</p>
<p>“The terms GENERATIVE_VOID and NONGENERATIVE_VOID can be re-expressed in a way that avoids implying causality. GENERATIVE_VOID may instead be called NONEXCLUSIVE_VOID, denoting a boundless context in which noumena and phenomena happen to exist without necessarily being caused by that void. NONGENERATIVE_VOID may instead be called EXCLUSIVE_VOID, denoting a hypothetical context in which no noumena or phenomena exist at all. This framing emphasizes that these voids need not act as substrates or causal agents, but rather describe whether the possibility of phenomena is included or excluded.”</p>
<p>This would (a) preserve the original contrast, (b) strip away the implication of an active “giving rise,” and (c) align the terminology more with logical set-membership (inclusive vs. exclusive) than with causal metaphysics.</p>
<p>Would you like me to draft a full revised NATURE section with this alternative terminology, so you could drop it straight into the page if you wanted?</p>
