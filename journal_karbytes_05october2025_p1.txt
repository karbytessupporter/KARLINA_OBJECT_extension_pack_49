During the past 3 days, karbytes saved every file of karbytes to the WayBack Machine at least one time and recorded its progress in the following plain-text journal entries:

At the top of each of those journal entries (and beneath the journal file meta data) is a succinct description of karbytes' WayBack Machine saving procedure for the karbytes file collection. That process description is as follows (with placeholder text for specific calendar day dates such as 05_OCTOBER_2025 and 06_OCTOBER_2025):

The following list of karbytes "micro directory" names denotes each set of sub-index URLs which karbytes saved every file URL of successfully to the WayBack Machine (using the Save Page Now web UI with the "save outlinks" option selected) during the time interval starting at 5:01PM Pacific Standard Time on [UNDEFINED_DAY] and ending at 4:59PM Pacific Standard Time on [UNDEFINED_DAY.get_next_day()].

Note that, if a particular WayBack Machine Save Page Now save operation for a particular file URL or a particular sub-index URL failed upon the first attempt, karbytes repeatedly spammed the WayBack Machine with that same Save Page Now operation until the operation was successful.

Note that sometimes the WayBack Machine removes or fails to immediately display particular URL snapshots. Hence, karbytes' goal is to save each file URL of karbytes to WayBack as many times as possible during karbytes' lifespan (and ideally each (final draft version of each) file of karbytes will be saved to the WayBack Machine at least one hundred times).
