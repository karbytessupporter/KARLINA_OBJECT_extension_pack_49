The following journal entry content is intended by its author to be interpreted as satire more so than prose to be taken literally (though it could be interpreted as such).

Human children are the only people who really matter to humans in general.

It is implied that adult humans are only valuable to human civilization if they (a) bare and/or raise human offspring and/or (b) provide services and products which support people doing a.

If human adults fail or cease to be doing either a or b, then those human adults are regarded as delinquents deserving of overt or covert punishment and ultimately being assigned a much lower priority level (in terms of being invested in for the purpose of supporting their survival and thrival) than (c) adult humans who are consistently performing a and/or b or (d) minor humans with clean criminal records.

Humans of all ages which have criminal records are never truly forgiven by human society for any of their crimes (and their criminal status permanently lowers the convict’s aforementioned priority level. That is to maximize the likelihood that criminal lineages go extinct while non-criminal lineages continue to survive for an indefinitely long time.

Having a crippling disability is functionally treated as having a potentially expungeable criminal conviction (but such a lowered priority status is only raised if the respective person loses the crippling disability). Senility is generally treated as an incurable and inevitable crippling disability which only becomes more severe over time.

karbytes_0: “There is more to life than merely making babies and supporting the system in a utilitarian fashion. For instance, people can also create and consume art.”

karbytes_1: “I agree with what you’re saying, but I still argue that making babies and serving society in a utilitarian manner are ultimately all that deserve praise and rewarding incentives. The other stuff you mentioned is merely self-indulgence and only provides entertainment value.”

karbytes_0: “Life without entertainment options beyond making babies and supporting the system in a utilitarian manner sounds so boring and tiring that I would consider that life to not be worth living.”

karbytes_1: “In some times and places people don’t have any options but making babies and/or serving society in a utilitarian fashion. If you were relegated to such locales, you too would be constrained to those options you find to be insufficiently meaningful to yoi and you would be prevented from deviating behavioral and cognitively from such norms (and from committing suicide). Such norms have been in place for most of human civilization. Only in the past 100 years has there been any real exceptions available to the masses.”

karbytes_0: “In the future I imagine a utopia where every human (regardless of its age, disability status, and criminal status) would be provided an unconditional basic income sufficient to pay for that person to live for as long as it wants to in dignified conditions free of deliberate cruelty. (People who pose a threat to other people’s safety and civil liberties would only be incarcerated or revoked of freedoms to the extent that is necessary to prevent harm to all persons and such incarcerated individuals would always be treated as potentially redeemable rather than left to rot in prison indefinitely). As extreme as this sounds, I imagine all (new) people in that world being born sterile through genome manipulation and all new society members exclusively being created in government-run laboratories using randomized and optimized genomes, cloned stem cells, and artificial wombs to produce batches of new humans as needed to maintain an optimum population size (and such babies would be raised in state-run boarding schools until such people become adults and able to live independently). People who require assisted living would be guaranteed such accommodations because the society’s economy would be calibrated to ensure supply and demand are always in balance.”

karbytes_0: “Is this blog post really supposed to be taken as satirical or did karbytes mean for it to be taken literally?”

karbytes_1: “karbytes meant for this blog post to be taken mostly as hyperbole (i.e. satire) because karbytes currently thinks that many if not most humans think that adult humans have just as much intrinsic worth as what minor humans have (and that such intrinsic worth is based solely on having a sufficiently high degree of sentience (i.e. human capacity to experience pain, pleasure, and possibly even thoughts)).”

karbytes_0: “It sounds to me like what you’re saying is that karbytes is saying the following: what exclusively makes an organism worth being preserved and spared as much suffering as possible is that organism being simultaneously alive and sufficiently sentient.“

karbytes_1: “Yes, that is correct.”
