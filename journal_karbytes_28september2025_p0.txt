It seems that many people (especially people I don't know personally but who seem to know about me and my delinquent and troubled past) think I deserve to be in prison for at least a decade (but likely for several more decades or even centuries) and are taking it upon themselves personally to spite me and to make my life outside of prison as punitive towards me as possible.

Obviously, I take my own side in this matter and insist that I deserve to thrive as much as possible and to be treated as someone who is sufficiently reformed and essentially now innocent (i.e. cleared of any criminal convictions, debilitating mental illness diagnoses, and the stigma of such things). Otherwise, I would act and feel more deserving of punishment and deprivation of satisfaction to the extent that I would resemble a depressed person lacking ambition outside of surviving at a very low caste with the uncontested premise that I think that I'm being rightfully punished through severely restricted employment and recreational options and being subject to unmitigatable psychological harassment and maybe even physical violence and vandalism or theft of my property by the "good samaritans" dealing such punishment and societal gatekeeping; government agents and civilians alike.

The purpose of this note is to show that I acknowledge that what I described in this note could really be my plight. If it is, then I continue to advocate for my own happiness and dignity in life according to the specifications outlined in the following two documents. Otherwise, I'm being paranoid for what I think are strategic reasons (i.e. to prepare myself for being a victim of "bait and switch" campaigns, bullying, ostracization, censorship, theft, vandalism, violence (especially the retaliatory variety), and neglect especially due to being relegated to a low caste in society).

Ultimately, I think that no person is objectively more deserving of happiness than any other person given that I prefer to promote an ethic that, if a person is alive and sentient, then that person deserves to thrive to the fullest extent possible. The only limitation to that ethic is interpersonal and ecological boundaries; however abstract they are. 

Precisely, I condone each person to be allowed as much opportunity to thrive as possible but such that one person's thrival does not hinder another person's thrival. This is mostly an abstract and generalist ideal I have about how society ought to operate. In practice, each person and situation is unique and hence, in my opinion, should be treated as a special case requiring nuanced and science-based reasoning with the goal always being to minimize every person's suffering and to maximize every person's freedom. Retribution is something I think ought to be discouraged, prevented, and minimized. I would say the same for polluting the environment with toxic chemicals and subjecting sentient non-human animals to suffering and violence. 

I find it lonely to be the only vegan and non-retributionist I currently know. Currently, my approach is to avoid talking about my political or philosophical views "in person" unless explicitly invited to do so by the other party. Hence, the only context in which I speak in a relatively uncensored and open manner is via the World Wide Web (particularly through social media platforms and my own personal websites).

Aside from not wanting to bore nor overwhelm people with the often "heavy" and "out of context" things I am prone to think about and discuss relatively anonymously online, I also don't want to trigger people's envy or sense that I am trying to "one up" them by "showing off" how privileged, educated, or talented I think I am in comparison to them. As much as I wish I could always come across as "down to earth" and likeable to everyone I come into contact with, I think I inevitably fail at times to exemplify such universal agreeability, likeability, and appropriate context awareness. Hence, my default stance is to avoid talking unless it seems like talking to other people unless they initiate conversation with me.

I'm not exactly angry at humanity but I do think humanity has some flaws it may eventually learn to overcome. In the meantime, I find it helpful to treat each human like just another version of me (albeit a more specially customized version based on that individual's own unique life experiences and physiology). It's not difficult for me to feel empathy for each of my fellow humans but there are some humans so miserable and dysfunctional I prefer to avoid imagining what it would be like to be in their position because to so so means I would have to violate my own ethical principles (merely by allocating scarce cognitive resources towards thinking like them to the exclusion of thinking like me).

In the future I may deviate from being as  passive as I said I currently am during most "in person" contexts. I might be more socially outgoing and willing to initiate or perpetuate conversation in some "in person" contexts. My general preferences seem to match that of an introvert more so than that of an extrovert (though I can deviate from such personality "default settings" as I see fit or as I otherwise am compelled to do). I expect that, the vast majority of my time alive will be spent while I play the role of an introvert more than that of an extrovert because such seems to be most tailored to my personal goals and tastes.

This is a bit speculative, but I have a rather controversial hypothesis that a propensity towards extroversion over introversion is not as developmentally advanced as is a propensity towards introversion over extroversion. My reasoning for that is that it seems that the former has too little knowledge to find solitude sufficiently stimulating and hence seek to avoid boredom and internal desolation by turning to other people for entertainment and distraction from such a void of imagination and knowledge.
