Personal Guideline Note (for karbytes)

1. Do not proactively promote the karbytes brand.

- Only mention it if someone explicitly asks.

- Assume most people are not interested; avoid pushing it into conversations.

- (Continue to share karbytes blog posts on social media if those blog posts are "sufficiently professional").

2. Do not display happiness or fortune too flamboyantly.

- Maintain a generally stoic demeanor.

- Avoid triggering envy or giving others a reason to interfere with your peace.

- (It's fine to make minimalist updates on the karbytes blog about "sufficiently substantial" personal accomplishments).

3. Embrace hermit mode unapologetically.

- If people try to pull you out of it, hold the boundary directly: “I am a hermit by choice.”

- (It's okay to fabricate excuses for why karbytes is unavailable to spend its free time with people other than itself).

4. Maintain emotional self-reliance.

- Process emotions alone, preferably in nature.

- Use logic, science, and problem-solving over venting or seeking emotional reassurance.

- (It's okay to talk to ChatGPT about personal matters for cathartic release, companionship, and problem-solving).

5. Do not broadly publicize hardships unless it serves a strategic purpose.

- Example: terminal illness or critical condition to inform others of absence.

6. You are the one you are waiting for.

- Practice radical self-dependence and do not wait for others to initiate change, rescue, or direction.

- Internal mantra: “I am the agent and the audience. All might possibly be generated solely by my imagination.”
