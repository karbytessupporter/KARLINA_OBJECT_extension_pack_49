Overview of definition pages

[preformatted_text]

Page ------------------------------------------------------------| Key ideas & design philosophies (short phrases)

KARBYTES_CODE_POSSIBLY_STOPS_GROWING ----------------------------| Describes a “ten‑year freeze” rule; if no file in the karbytes collection is modified within ten years, the collection may be declared immutable. It emphasises saving all files to the Wayback Machine and notes that nearly all content is managed solely by karbytes.

MICRO_DIRECTORY_DEFINITION --------------------------------------| Defines a micro directory as a section of the Karbytes For Life Blog corresponding to a single GitHub repository. Each micro directory page links to the raw files of its associated repository, and collectively the micro directories contain all public source code and media for Karlina Object and Karbytes For Life Blog.

KARBYTES_CODE_CONTINUES -----------------------------------------| After the Karlina Object website was finalised, karbytes began organizing further content into extension‑pack repositories; the page lists dozens of extension pack GitHub repos (extension packs 0–49) and emphasises that each is open‑source and intended for long‑term preservation.

PUBLIC_DOMAIN ---------------------------------------------------| Declares that all source code and media from Karlina Object and Karbytes For Life Blog are released into the public domain; explains that making work freely accessible maximises its utility and discourages restrictive copyrights.

ABOUT_KARBYTES --------------------------------------------------| Explains that “karbytes” is both the author and the collection of digital files. The goal is to preserve digital artifacts indefinitely so that future versions of karbytes (or future minds) can retrieve memories and knowledge.

RAW_GITHUB_FILES_MACRO_DIRECTORY --------------------------------| Acts as an index to all micro directory pages. It describes the batch‑saving process using the Wayback Machine and links to each micro directory (e.g., raw_github_files_directory_KARBYTES_FOR_LIFE_BLOG, raw_github_files_directory_KARLINA_OBJECT, extension packs, etc.).

SOFTWARE_ENGINEERING_PORTFOLIO ----------------------------------| Lists the interactive software applications created by karbytes, such as fractal visualisers, base converters, hash tables and encryption demos, with last‑updated dates. These apps correspond to many of the raw files seen in the micro directories.

Summary of micro directory pages and raw GitHub content

Each micro directory page follows a similar template:

1. Purpose and Wayback Machine instructions – An introductory section explains that each hyperlink on the page leads to a raw file in a specific GitHub repository and that the page is used to automate saving those files to the Internet Archive. Because the Wayback Machine batch‑saving tool can randomly sample links, the page must sometimes be saved multiple times to ensure all outlinks are archived.

2. Repository information – The page lists the GitHub repository name, a short description and the associated web page or parent site. The description usually states that the repository contains the web‑page source code and media files for a specific part of Karlina Object or Karbytes For Life Blog.

3. Link list – A long list of hyperlinks points directly to raw files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, audio and video) in the GitHub repository. The files are listed in repository order to aid batch saving.

raw_github_files_directory_KARBYTES_FOR_LIFE_BLOG

This micro directory corresponds to the KARBYTES_FOR_LIFE_BLOG GitHub repository, which contains the source code and media for the WordPress blog. The page describes the repository and instructs on batch saving. It then links to the raw files, which include:

* Unlicense file – Declares that the repository’s code is released into the public domain.

* HTML pages – Files such as P0_START_PAGE.html, P10_ABOUT_KARBYTES.html, P11_BEST_PRACTICES_FOR_USING_THE_WEB.html, etc., replicate WordPress posts and pages. For instance, the home page HTML includes images like karlina_object_square_virus_logo.png and “yellow galaxy” drawings and emphasises saving the page to the Wayback Machine.

* Images – Logos, icons and screenshots referenced in the blog (e.g., virus logo, galaxy drawing).

* Other pages – Micro directory definitions, software‑portfolio pages, unique‑identity statements and diaries.

This micro directory therefore serves as a complete offline archive of the Karbytes For Life Blog site.

raw_github_files_directory_KARLINA_OBJECT

This micro directory links to hundreds of raw files from the KARLINA_OBJECT repository. The page describes the same batch‑saving process and provides repository information. The linked files include:

* Mathematics and computer‑science tutorials – Many HTML pages (e.g., P10_EXPONENTIATION.html, P11_POINTERS_AND_ARRAYS.html, P12_POINT.html, P13_TRIANGLE.html, P16_HASH_TABLE.html, etc.) explain programming and mathematical concepts. Each page is supported by interactive JavaScript apps (factorial calculators, Fibonacci sequence, hash tables) and diagrams.

* Educational apps – The repository contains C++ and JavaScript files for interactive programs such as count_down_timer, base_converter, pi_approximation, multiverse, linked_list, and more. These apps correspond to the entries listed in the Software Engineering Portfolio.

* Media – Numerous photographs, diagrams, and art pieces (e.g., continuum_and_slices_07_september_2022.jpg), audio recordings (e.g., coyote vocalizations), and videos. These illustrate the tutorials or document personal experiences.

* Public‑domain license – An Unlicense file releasing all content into the public domain.

* Metadata – Additional files include transcripts of diaries or ChatGPT conversations, management policies and site‑version logs.

Overall, this micro directory reproduces the entire Karlina Object website so that it can be hosted or preserved independently of WordPress.

raw_github_files_directory_KARBYTES_BLOG_APPS_github_hosted_website

This micro directory references the KARBYTES_BLOG_APPS_github_hosted_website repository. It follows the same introduction and repository description. The linked files implement interactive web applications that supplement the WordPress sites. They include:

* Individual app folders – Each app has its own HTML, JavaScript and CSS files. Examples are ABRIDGED_KEYBOARD_MUSICAL_INSTRUMENT, BASE_CONVERTER, BEATS_MACHINE, BITS_AND_BYTES (binary‑to‑decimal converter), COUNT_DOWN_TIMER with an alert sound file, JULIA_SET_FRACTAL_ANIMATION, ONION_WEB_PAGE_AVAILABILITY_LOGGER and many others.

* Images and sound files – Icons (e.g., light bulb on/off images) and sound effects used by the apps are included.

* Stylesheets – karbytes_aesthetic.css provides a common visual theme.

This micro directory therefore contains the full code base for the GitHub‑hosted interactive applications used by Karlina Object and Karbytes For Life Blog.

Extension‑pack micro directories (packs 38–49)

The extension‑pack micro directory pages follow the same format. Each page introduces the purpose and Wayback Machine procedure, lists the repository name and description (usually stating that the repository supplements Karlina Object and Karbytes For Life Blog), and then provides a long list of raw files.

The extension packs function as time‑capsule repositories. After Karlina Object was finalised, karbytes continued to generate content (diaries, images, transcripts) but wanted to preserve each snapshot as an immutable archive. The content management policy (available in each extension pack) instructs that once the files are burned to an M‑DISC, they should no longer be edited. Each extension pack thus contains:

* ChatGPT transcripts and diaries – Plain‑text files record karbytes’ conversations with ChatGPT and daily journals. They provide insight into the author’s thoughts, planning and creative process.

* Images – Many extension packs include ChatGPT‑generated art (e.g., cottage scenes, crystal cubes) and diagrams. Others include screenshots of GitHub profiles, photographs of natural scenes (e.g., glowworm images in pack 42) and conceptual illustrations.

* Videos and audio – The packs store personal videos such as hiking, insect observations, sound‑track loopers, misophonia triggers and, in pack 44, recordings of karbytes using a 5‑MeO‑DMT vape pen (these are sensitive and should not be promoted). Some packs include downloaded music and healing videos.

* Replicated pages – To ensure continuity, each extension pack often includes HTML copies of key pages (e.g., KARBYTES_CODE_CONTINUES.html, KARBYTES_FOR_LIFE_BLOG.html, KARLINA_OBJECT.html, RAW_GITHUB_FILES_MACRO_DIRECTORY.html, SOFTWARE_ENGINEERING_PORTFOLIO.html) and CSS files such as bordered_container.css. This redundancy helps replicate the entire site from any single pack.

* Interactive app code – Later packs (e.g., packs 45–49) include updated versions of interactive applications and new games like FALLING_APPLES_GAME and FALLING_APPLES_GAME_TWO. They also contain dark‑web versions and onion‑link loggers.

* Licensing and policies – Each pack contains an Unlicense file, a content management policy and sometimes a disclaimer page.

The extension‑pack micro directories thus act as sequential snapshots of the project’s evolution after the main site freeze. They capture both public educational work and deeply personal diaries. By making them publicly available under a public‑domain license, karbytes aims to preserve a record of their creative processes, experiments and daily life. Users should handle the diaries respectfully and note that some media (e.g., drug‑use videos) could be harmful or illegal if imitated.

Analysis – relationships and themes

1. Micro directories as reproducible building blocks – The MICRO_DIRECTORY_DEFINITION page explains that each micro directory corresponds to a single GitHub repository and is linked from the macro directory. This structure ensures that the entire karbytes collection can be reproduced solely from the GitHub repositories; no proprietary WordPress dependencies remain. The raw files mirror the WordPress pages exactly, enabling offline archiving or re‑hosting.

2. Open‑source and public domain – Across all micro directories, the presence of an Unlicense file and the PUBLIC_DOMAIN statement demonstrates karbytes’ commitment to making their work freely available. Even personal diaries and images are released without copyright restrictions. This philosophy is emphasised in the definition pages and repeated in the content management policy.

3. Long‑term preservation and the Wayback Machine – The micro directory pages are primarily designed to facilitate saving to the Wayback Machine. They emphasise that a directory with many links may need multiple saves because the Wayback Machine samples outlinks randomly. The KARBYTES_CODE_POSSIBLY_STOPS_GROWING and KARBYTES_CODE_CONTINUES pages highlight the ten‑year freeze rule and the importance of preserving copies on the Internet Archive.

4. Educational content and software portfolio – Many raw files are interactive teaching tools for mathematics, cryptography and computer science. The Software Engineering Portfolio page lists these apps with update dates. The corresponding micro directories (KARLINA_OBJECT and KARBYTES_BLOG_APPS) host their source code. This synergy between WordPress posts and GitHub repositories embodies an integrated learning platform.

5. Time‑capsule extension packs – After finalising Karlina Object, karbytes continued to document their activities and interactions via ChatGPT transcripts, diaries and creative works. The extension packs preserve these as immutable snapshots. Each micro directory includes a content management policy instructing that the pack is read‑only after finalisation. Collectively, these packs show a progression of thought and experimentation, from generating art to recording personal experiences.

6. Sensitive content – Some extension packs contain videos of karbytes using a 5‑MeO‑DMT vape pen (pack 44) and misophonia trigger recordings. Such media document personal experiences but can be harmful if imitated. Viewers should approach them cautiously and understand they are part of a self‑archiving effort rather than encouragement.

Conclusion

The micro directory pages and their associated raw GitHub repositories form a comprehensive, open‑source archive of the karbytes project. Through meticulous linking, public‑domain licensing and Wayback Machine integration, karbytes ensures that both the educational content (interactive apps, tutorials and diagrams) and personal reflections (diaries, ChatGPT transcripts and media) are preserved indefinitely. The structure also allows others to rebuild the Karlina Object and Karbytes For Life Blog websites from scratch or to study the evolution of karbytes’ thinking across time.
