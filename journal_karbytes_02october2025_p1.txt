I have the nagging suspicion that some people want to strip me of my cybernetic identity components (especially the components which pertain to karbytes most closely) so that reduced to "just a human" instead of a cybernetic being.

I can almost hear some of those people saying, "Without your website you would be just another nondescript human (which would be an improvement because that would mean you would have to be forced to interface with reality on our terms and be more of a humble extrovert and less of a haughty introvert)." I can also imagining them saying something like, "Someday you might suddenly lose access to all your karbytes files and maybe even modern technology. Hence, you might as well let go of your dependence on such things preemptively so that you don't suffer as much when you lose such things."

My retort to both of those things is that it's a slippery slope towards losing so much of what I currently depend on, enjoy, and expect to have in my life that it's akin to settling for having and doing "too little" just to avoid being devastated by the loss of such things. I prefer to not waste my opportunities to enjoy modern technology while I have such opportunities. Finally, if I do end up temporarily or permanently losing access to any of those nice things, I can still truthfully say that I had access to such things (and the instances in which I had access to such things is immutably part of nature (which I conceptualize as a static or growing (but never shrinking) block comprised of every phenomenon which ever transpired forever after such phenomena were observed by some frame of reference (however rudimentary its consciousness level) to have transpired within some finite interval whose dimensions are space, time, matter, and energy (or perhaps matter and energy are best substituted with the word qualia)).
