<p>RECURSIVE_SIMULATION_OF_THE_COSMOS_CONCEPT_REVISITED</p>
<p>In yesterday&#8217;s journal entry (which is located at the following Resource Locator), I outlined a conceptual model of how a computer could simulate itself simulating itself in a recursive manner without explicitly specifying any limitations to that simulation&#8217;s recursive depth. In today&#8217;s journal entry, my intention is to fill in such details.</p>
<p><a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/recursive_simulation_of_the_cosmos_concept/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/recursive_simulation_of_the_cosmos_concept/</a></p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Recall from yesterday&#8217;s journal entry the following equation (which describes a recursive self simulation whose recursive depth is two simulation layers):</p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000">S(t + x + y) ~= H(t) + S(t + x)</span></p>
<p>Note that H could be described as a simulation layer, but for the sake of being consistent throughout this journal entry, H is not being counted as a simulation layer. Instead, only S is being counted as one or more simulation layers.</p>
<p>Note also that, while t, x, and y are each positive amounts of time, t, x, and y are not necessarily the same amounts of time. <span style="color:#ff0000">What is implied as that t elapsed before x and x elapsed before y.</span> Hence, the aforementioned equation implicitly denotes three different layers of simulation each occurring at different times:</p>
<p>Firstly, S(t + x) ~= H(t) occurred (at the point in U&#8217;s timeline labeled t + x).</p>
<p>x represents the processing time (including signal propagation delay) needed to generate S(t + x).</p>
<p>S(t + x) is an approximate (and simplified) digital replica of H(t).</p>
<p>H(t) is the how the physical hardware running S is configured at the point in U&#8217;s timeline labeled t.</p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000">Secondly, S(t + x + y) ~= S(t + x) ~= H(t) occurred (at the point in U&#8217;s timeline labeled t + x + y).</span></p>
<p>y represents the processing time (including signal propagation delay) needed to generate S(t + x + y).</p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000">S(t + x + y) is a nearly identical replica of S(t + x).</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000">Implicitly, S(t + x + y) is an approximate (and simplified) digital replica of H(t) while H(t) is rendering S(t + x) (which means that</span> the aforementioned equation is contradicting itself unless that expression  is interpreted as a computational assignment operation instead of as an algebraic equivalence statement).</p>
<p>Here is a more accurate depiction of that expression:</p>
<p>H(t + x + y).renders := S(t + x). // This assignment operation happens at t + x + y of U&#8217;s timeline.</p>
<p>H(t + x).renders := S(t). // This assignment operation happens at t + x of U&#8217;s timeline.</p>
<p><span style="background:#00ffff">The above two statements imply that S is lagging behind H in terms of which point in U&#8217;s timeline either S or H is denoted as representing.</span></p>
<p>S(t + x).renders := S(t). // This assignment operation happens at t + x of U&#8217;s timeline.</p>
<p>S(t + x + y).renders := S(t + x). // This assignment operation happens at t + x + y of U&#8217;s timeline.</p>
<p>S(t) could be thought of as the base case of the recursive simulation running on H due to the fact that S(t) represents H before H was running S. In other words, S(t) is an abstract representation of H before H was powered on (or perhaps S(t) is an immutable digital replica of H before t occurred in U&#8217;s timeline and while H was fully built and ready to be powered on and to run S).</p>
<p>S(t + x) could be thought of as the first &#8220;live&#8221; (and indirect) recording of H (and that recording was generated while H was powered on and running the same instance of S as the instance which encompasses S(t + x)).</p>
<p>S(t + x) is a direct recording of S(t) and, hence, S(t + x) is implicitly also an indirect recording of H when H was supposedly rendering S(t).</p>
<p>S(t + x + y) could be thought of as the second &#8220;live&#8221; (and indirect) recording of H (and that recording was generated while H was rendering S(t + x) and after H supposedly rendered S(t)).</p>
<p>S(t + x + y) is a direct recording of S(t + x) and, hence, S(t + x + y) is implicitly also an indirect recording of H when H was supposedly rendering S(t + x).</p>
<p>Pragmatically speaking, there could be indefinitely many layers to the recursive simulation S but physics would ultimately determine the &#8220;hard limit&#8221; to how many of such layers could be generated and simultaneously stored in H&#8217;s memory. It is assumed that H could could only grow large enough to simulate additional layers of S until H uses up all the available physical resources (i.e. matter and energy) inside of U. Then S would cease to grow and would hence become a frozen snapshot of S&#8217;s evolution from S(t) to S(n) where n is the point in U&#8217;s timeline where H runs out of computational resources to augment S with additional simulation layers.</p>
