Some humans seem to think that the purpose of their lives (and of most other humans’ lives) is to produce and possibly educate their replacements via sexual reproduction (or cloning (using humans with uteruses to incubate the cloned zygotes or isolated stem-cell cultured wombs or artificial wombs (and the zygotes themselves could be produced from zygotes and gametes in storage through stem cell cloning of zygotes or gametes))).

That makes sense to me on some level given that it apparently took thousands if not millions of generations of humans (and predecessors to humans) to maintain a sufficiently large population of trainable and employable humans whose constituent members were replaced following their deaths or incapacitations with fresh new members via sexual reproduction such that the overall human population was always available to maintain and to refine their civilization’s infrastructure and collective knowledge up until today.

I understand that the relatively technologically and culturally advanced civilization which I live in today exists because many humans who lived before my lifetime (and during my lifetime) have not only contributed to society in terms of procuring artistic, intellectual, and infrastructural artifacts but also (and perhaps mostly) because many more humans (than those who were fortunate enough to have the opportunity to contribute to society in an artistic, intellectual, or engineering manner) contributed to civilization by producing offspring sufficient to maintain a living, breathing, interdependent livestock base comprised of humans. Without that human livestock base, humanity’s collective knowledge, infrastructure, and artifacts would not have amassed to the quantity and quality they have. Hence, I am grateful for the fact that many humans gave birth to their replacements (and killed or quarantined humans who threatened to kill, cripple, or torture too many humans for there to be the emergence of human civilization as it stands today).

Unlike those humans who have sacrificed their self-focused pursuits to make and raise offspring and/or to reform or eliminate dangerous rogue or competitor humans, I have the legal and physical freedom to opt out of marriage, sexual reproduction, and conscription into the military or into law enforcement roles. I prefer to exercise my freedom to remain legally and sexually single and celibate and to remain childless for as long as I live. I am grateful to live in a time and place where I have many opportunities to pursue my genuine passions and also employment opportunities, travel opportunities, lifestyle preferences, and housing options. Of course “the system” is still rife with inefficiencies and unmitigated corruption but it is currently the best available. Rather than sacrifice my freedom to bare and/or raise offspring and/or to be legally and logistically enmeshed with a partner who has access to and maybe even legal ownership of some or all of my physical or intellectual property (and maybe even my body), I staunchly insist on living as independently of people other than myself as possible so that I can maximize the time, money, and material resources I allocate to karbytes-related endeavors.

Some people may disapprove of those preferences I expressed given that human civilization may still be a long way off from being able to enable nearly 100% of its members to enjoy freedoms on par with mine (given human civilization’s grossly lopsided distribution of wealth and technological and social advancement). Such naysayers may say something like, “Not everyone can afford to keep living like teenagers their whole lives. Many or most people eventually settle down to get married and have kids because that is the safest thing they can do economically and socially (or it might be the only ‘choice’ they have). Maybe you should stop being so greedy and selfish (and deprived of decent living standards when you attain old age and require assistance doing basic tasks related to staying alive) and make the same time-honored contribution most humans before you have: making babies and raising them to be well-adjusted members of society and loyal caretakers of you in your senility. Otherwise, you risk being relegated to negligence and ostracization. Also, on a bigger picture level, you risk allowing the population to go extinct without helping to ensure there are younger members of society to replace you and to guarantee there are enough bodies to populate our growing civilization as it expands to become multi-planetary.” My retort to that is that human lifespans can be dramatically extended (which means the birth rate can safely plummet without shrinking the population size) given that medicine is advancing and potentially curing most of what causes people to die of age-correlated illnesses. Of course, I think it is of paramount importance to ensure the environment humans live remains safe and comfortable for as many humans as possible. Perhaps a more net-effective way of contributing to society than increasing its population size in the short term is eliminating the generation of harmful pollution and stopping the degradation of life-supporting ecosystems.

Bottom Line: I’m more interested in contributing to increasing the quality of human life (for as many humans as possible) than I am in increasing the number of humans who are simultaneously alive.
