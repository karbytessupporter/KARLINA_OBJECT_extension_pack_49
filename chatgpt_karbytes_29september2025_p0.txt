Sure! I will begin by loading the web page at https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/NATURE_09july2025/ and note its contents. Then I'll explore and describe the key points of the pages it links to. I'll provide a structured summary once I've gathered the information.


Thought
The NATURE_09july2025 page on KARBYTES_FOR_LIFE_BLOG is essentially a lightly edited mirror of an earlier “NATURE” article from the author’s karlina_object site. After a note explaining that the body of the article comes from the 09 July 2025 version of the NATURE page, the post contains a colourful illustration of a large cube built from eight smaller cubes

. The article then discusses metaphysics‑style concepts. It defines PURE NOTHINGNESS as an “absence of both phenomena and noumena”—a field of non‑existence that exists everywhere and nowhere simultaneously
karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com
. The author stresses that pure nothingness is not the same as vacuum energy; vacuum energy is described as a zero‑point field that (according to some cosmological models) predates space, time, matter and energy
karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com
. A PHENOMENON is defined as a finite region of space perceived as containing quantifiable features, illustrated by a light sensor detecting 700‑nm light and a human perceiving the color red
karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com
. A FRAME OF REFERENCE is an allocation of pure nothingness in which an “information processing agent” detects the presence or absence of phenomena; partial frames experience a single present moment while an omniscient frame would render all partial frames simultaneously
karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com
. A NOUMENON is a phenomenon that is not being observed by a given frame of reference

.

The post links to numerous related pages:

karlina_object – NATURE – The source of the post’s definitions. This page uses similar structure but introduces additional categories such as NONGENERATIVE VOID (an absolutely ubiquitous absence of any phenomenon or noumenon
karlinaobject.wordpress.com
) and GENERATIVE VOID, a substrate that contains all noumena and gives rise to all phenomena; it notes that this generative void might encompass a ubiquitous field of zero‑point energy
karlinaobject.wordpress.com
. It repeats the definitions of phenomenon, frame of reference, and noumenon and includes a short pseudocode example to show how one frame can observe something that another frame does not
karlinaobject.wordpress.com
karlinaobject.wordpress.com
. Like the blog post, the page states that the content was last updated 28 September 2025 and is released to the public domain
karlinaobject.wordpress.com
.

karlina_object – AGENCY – This page explains the author’s concept of agency. Agency is described as an emergent property of a sufficiently complex information processing agent that allows it to generate a virtual model of its environment and to control which phenomena appear in its frame of reference
karlinaobject.wordpress.com
. An information processing agent is defined as a partition of nature that consists of a finite allocation of space, time, matter and energy and that perceives, decides and acts to attain goals
karlinaobject.wordpress.com
. The page describes how such agents learn, form goals, perceive, decide and execute actions
karlinaobject.wordpress.com
karlinaobject.wordpress.com
. It also notes that the material was last updated on 10 July 2025 and is public domain
karlinaobject.wordpress.com
.

karlina_object – NUMBERS – This mathematically oriented page defines numbers as pieces of information representing unique abstract patterns
karlinaobject.wordpress.com
. It explains that “one” is the smallest natural number and corresponds to the length of a unit interval on a Cartesian axis
karlinaobject.wordpress.com
, while “zero” represents the absence of a countable phenomenon and sits halfway between −1 and 1
karlinaobject.wordpress.com
. The page discusses how numbers can have finite or infinite representations, emphasising that numbers are abstract but must be stored physically by information processing agents
karlinaobject.wordpress.com
. Additional sections on infinity, natural numbers, integers and rational numbers provide mathematical definitions and examples
karlinaobject.wordpress.com
. Like other pages on the site, it is part of a publicly available metaphysical/mathematical library.

KARBYTES_FOR_LIFE_BLOG (home page) – The blog’s main landing page describes itself as an archive of the author’s social‑media posts and files
karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com
. It contains a directory listing numerous pages such as software engineering portfolio, micro directory definition and karbytes ontology (each with an update timestamp)
karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com
. The page lists the author’s identity (Karbytes, legally Karlina Ray Beringer), birth date (13 January 1990), and contact information
karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com
. It notes that every page on the site has been saved to the Wayback Machine and that the blog was established on 7 August 2022
karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com
. The content is in the public domain

.

karlina_object (home page) – This companion site is described as an expression of the author’s interest in metaphysics, physics, computer science, mathematics and digital media
karlinaobject.wordpress.com
. It links to a rich directory of pages (e.g., Knowledge, Triangle Graphing, Probability, Base Converter)
karlinaobject.wordpress.com
. The page provides similar author details and networking links and states that each page is archived and released to the public domain

In addition to these primary links, NATURE_09july2025 includes pointers to encyclopedic topics such as vacuum or zero‑point energy, space, time, matter, energy, electronics, light, human perception, qualitative/quantitative distinctions, and omniscience. These links lead to external reference pages (mostly Wikipedia) and serve to support the metaphysical definitions. The page also links to a license notice explaining that the content is public domain and to WordPress functions like “sign up” and “log in” (standard parts of the site template). Overall, the network of pages linked from NATURE_09july2025 forms part of a self‑referential online encyclopedia in which the author describes foundational concepts in metaphysics, mathematics, computing and personal worldview, while making all content freely available under a public‑domain license.
