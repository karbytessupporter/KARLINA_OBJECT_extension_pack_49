<p><span style="background: #ffff00">The following terms and their respective definitions describe <strong>nature</strong> (i.e. the whole of reality (i.e. all that exists)) as being the only set which contains all phenomena, all noumena, and all non-existence.</span></p>
<p><em>To view hidden text inside of the preformatted text box below, scroll horizontally.</em></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>NONGENERATIVE_VOID:</strong> an absolutely ubiquitous absence of any phenomenon and also of any noumenon.</p>
<p><span style="background:#00ffff">Given that this web page (among other phenomena) have been observed to exist by at least one frame of reference (namely yours), any instance of nongenerative void is proven to be absolutely non-existent according to that frame of reference.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>GENERATIVE_VOID:</strong> an absolutely ubiquitous substrate which unconditionally contains all noumena and which gives rise to and contains all phenomena.</p>
<p>Note that a generative void may possibly encompass a ubiquitous (and infinitely large) &#8220;field&#8221; of <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-point_energy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">zero-point energy</a> such that the &#8220;field&#8221; of zero-point energy never had an emergence point in time nor will ever vanish (implying that such a field comprised of zero-point energy is functionally indistinguishable from any &#8220;underlying&#8221; generative void).</p>
<p><span style="background:#00ffff">In the context of this web page, the term &#8220;background nothingness&#8221; implies the unconditional and ubiquitous presence of an irreducible and featureless substrate &#8220;on top of&#8221; which all phenomena transpire and which inherently &#8220;contains&#8221; all noumena.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>PHENOMENON:</strong> (plural: phenomena) a finite region of background nothingness in which some frame of reference renders (and observes) specific quantifiable features necessarily denoting contrast from the underlying background nothingness.</p>
<p>An example of a phenomenon is a light sensor inside of an <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">electronic</a> circuit detecting incoming <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light" target="_blank" rel="noopener">light</a> whose wavelengths are exactly 700 nanometers and not some other wavelength such as 470 nanometers.</p>
<p>A <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human" target="_blank" rel="noopener">human</a> nervous system which perceives incoming light (which enters the eyes and which causes a corresponding electrical signal to be sent across the optical nerves and to the visual processing circuits of the brain) whose wavelengths are exactly 700 nanometers consciously experiences the phenomenon of the color <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red" target="_blank" rel="noopener">red</a>.</p>
<p>The <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">qualitative</a> phenomenon referred to as the color red is distinct from the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quantitative</a> phenomenon referred to as the <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">number</a> 700.</p>
<p><span style="background:#00ffff">Numbers are not directly observable the way qualia are, but numbers nevertheless exist as abstract <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/knowledge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data</a> inside of the photonic and electronic interactions generated by computational hardware and (are verified to exist by the computers which render those numbers).</span></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>FRAME_OF_REFERENCE:</strong> an allocation of background nothingness in which some <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information processing agent</a> detects the presence or the absence of a particular phenomenon (at particular &#8220;point&#8221; in space and time).</p>
<p>A partial frame of reference experiences itself as being localized to <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;the present moment&#8221;</a> within the context of exactly one linear and perpetually forward-moving (through time) <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spacetime continuum</a>.</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00">Formally, a frame of reference localized to a particular <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/point/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;point&#8221;</a> in time, <strong>t</strong>, could be symbolically represented as <strong>R(t)</strong> while the entire perception-memory structure, <strong>R</strong>, which R(t) is an element of could be conceptually modeled as the summation of all R(t) where t represents any unique and irreducibly small increment of <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/count_down_timer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">time</a> elapsing according to R.</span></p>
<p><span style="background:#00ffff">An <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omniscience" target="_blank" rel="noopener">omniscient</a> (rather than partial) frame of reference would render all partial frames of reference simultaneously and, hence, would be aware of all phenomena (wherever they occur) simultaneously. Furthermore, an omniscient frame of reference would be cognizant of every noumenon (and there are infinitely many &#8220;phenomenally distinct&#8221; noumena and infinitely many copies of each &#8220;phenomenally distinct&#8221; noumenon).</span></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>NOUMENON:</strong> (plural: noumena) a specific phenomenon which is not being directly observed by some partial frame of reference (at particular &#8220;point&#8221; in space and time).</p>
<p><span style="background:#00ffff">Note that an information processing agent registering the thought of some phenomenon which that information processing agent is not immediately observing (at some point in space and time) counts as a phenomenon rather than the noumenon that thought abstractly represents.</span></p>
<p>Suppose that two unique partial frames of reference exist and that one of those frames of reference, A, is observing some phenomenon, X, while the other frame of reference, B, is not observing X. Then, according to B, X is a noumenon. In pseudocode that can be represented as follows:</p>
<pre>
A.is_observing(X) = true. // A experiences X as a phenomenon.
B.is_observing(X) = false. // B "experiences" X as a noumenon.
</pre>
