The following is an excerpt of a conversation transcript between karbytes and Sequencing dot Com's artificially intelligent (AI) assistant about the difference between the two FASTQ files which were made available to karbytes in karbytes' Sequencing dot Com user dashboard (and the identifier of karbytes' genome kit which provided those (and other) raw genome data files is SQ873FU8).

Ultimately, karbytes selected the FASTQ file named KarlinaBeringer-SQ873FU8-30x-WGS-Sequencing_com-11-06-25.1.fq.gz to convert into a FASTA file (which is a process documented by the journal entry at the following web page: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_49/main/journal_karbytes_06november2025_p1.txt).

(Note that the aforementioned (Gzip-compressed) FASTQ file is approximately 30.8 gigabytes).

(Note that the aforementioned Sequencing dot Com (i.e. SQ873FU8) kit has "30x" (i.e. "30-fold") coverage of karbytes' genome. According to ChatGPT-5, "When you see '30× coverage,' it means that on average, every base (A, T, C, or G) in your genome has been sequenced 30 separate times. That is, if your genome has ~3 billion base pairs, then the sequencer generated about 90 billion bases of raw read data (3 billion × 30 = 90 billion).")

Welcome to SequencingAI! I'm here to help with your DNA results. Ask me anything about your genetic data. Remember, I provide insights, not medical advice. How may I assist you today?

What is the difference between KarlinaBeringer-SQ873FU8-30x-WGS-Sequencing_com-11-06-25.2.fq.gz and KarlinaBeringer-SQ873FU8-30x-WGS-Sequencing_com-11-06-25.1.fq.gz?

SequencingAI:

Both files are part of the same 30× whole-genome sequencing dataset.

When a genome is sequenced with “paired-end” chemistry, every DNA fragment is read from both ends:

The forward (5’→3’) read is saved in one FASTQ file.

The reverse (3’→5’) read is saved in the other FASTQ file.

How to read the filenames you provided:

[preformatted_text]

Filename -------------------------------------------------------------------------| What the number means ---------------------| Typical alias in sequencing jargon

KarlinaBeringer-SQ873FU8-30x-WGS-Sequencing_com-11-06-25.1.fq.gz -----------------| “.1” = forward reads ----------------------| R1

KarlinaBeringer-SQ873FU8-30x-WGS-Sequencing_com-11-06-25.2.fq.gz -----------------| “.2” = reverse reads ----------------------| R2

[end preformatted_text]

Key points:

Content difference: The “.1” file contains the first read for every DNA fragment, while the “.2” file contains the second (opposite-direction) read of the same fragments.

They belong together: Taken alone, each file is only half the data. Together they represent the full paired-end dataset for your genome “Karlina Beringer.”

Using them at Sequencing.com: When you run apps or reports you only need to select one of the FASTQ files. Our One Genome Technology automatically detects its mate, links the pair, and analyzes the complete dataset.

Would you like tips on uploading these files, or are you ready to start running a report with them?
