karbytes:

“Hello, ChatGP!”

[video_icon] [audio_icon] 00:01
  
ChatGPT:
  
Hey there! Looks like you've got a pretty scenic view going on. Is that a nice hiking spot or just a favorite lookout?

karbytes:
  
“Nice hiking spot, it is Las Trampas Wilderness on the east side [of Bollinger Canyon Road].”

[audio_icon] 00:05 
  
ChatGPT:

Oh, awesome! Las Trampas is definitely a beautiful area. It's got that perfect mix of open ridges and shady spots. So I hope you're enjoying the hike and the fresh air out there!

karbytes:
  
“Oh, definitely. It's been a very magical hike. There's a lot of rocks and giant formations. The geography is amazing.”

[audio_icon] 00:08
  
ChatGPT:

That sounds fantastic. Those rock formations definitely add a bit of a mystical vibe to the place. It's like nature's own art gallery out there. I'm glad you're soaking it all in!

karbytes:
  
“Not to mention, oak trees are pretty epic, with lichens growing on them.”

[audio_icon] 00:03
  
ChatGPT:

Oh yeah, absolutely! Oaks with all that lichen on them just have this ancient, almost storybook feel. It's like every tree has its own little ecosystem. Definitely adds to the magic of the hike.

karbytes:
  
“Definitely, I'd say it's magical. Well, I just had some thoughts. I was wondering, just out of curiosity, how many gigabytes is the Christian Bible?”

[audio_icon] 00:09
  
ChatGPT:
  
Oh, that's a fun little curiosity! So the entire text of the Bible, if you're just looking at plain text in, say, a typical English translation, is actually pretty small. It's usually only a few megabytes—somewhere around 4 to 5 megabytes of just pure text. If you start adding things like high-resolution images, commentaries, or if you have a scanned version, then yeah, it can go into hundreds of megabytes or even a gigabyte or two. But just the text alone is pretty lightweight in the grand scheme of digital things.

karbytes:
  
“Wow, I didn't know that. I thought it was like a few gigabytes.”

[audio_icon] 00:04
  
ChatGPT:

Yeah, it's kind of surprising how compact text can be. Once you strip away all the fancy formatting or images, just plain words really don't take up that much space. So definitely not gigabytes—just a handful of megabytes if it's just the text.

karbytes:
  
“How about the Qur'an?”

[audio_icon] 00:01
  
ChatGPT:

Sure, it's a similar idea! The Quran in plain text form is also pretty small. Usually, it's a bit less than the Bible, maybe around 1 to 2 megabytes in just plain text. Of course, if you have translations, annotations, or any kind of illuminated manuscript scans, that can add a lot of size. But the core text by itself is just a couple of megabytes as well.

karbytes:
  
“There's a few other holy texts I'm thinking of, but I kind of forgot their names. Something called the Gita.”

[audio_icon] 00:05
  
ChatGPT:

Yeah, that's probably the Bhagavad Gita you're thinking of. It's a well-known Hindu scripture, and in plain text it’s also not very large—maybe a few hundred kilobytes to a couple of megabytes, depending on the edition. So it's the same story: most of these texts are pretty compact when they're just text files. Once you add all the other goodies—images, commentary, and formatting—they do grow. Let me know if there are any others you're curious about!

karbytes:

“How about the Tao Te Ching?”

[audio_icon] 00:01
  
ChatGPT:
  
Yeah, the Tao Te Ching is another good example. It's actually a pretty short text compared to the others—it’s only about 5,000 Chinese characters in total. In plain text, that often comes out to well under a megabyte—just a few hundred kilobytes if it's only the raw text. So it's definitely one of the more compact classics. It just goes to show how a lot of wisdom can fit into a pretty tiny digital space!

karbytes:
  
“How about the English translation?”

[audio_icon] 00:01
  
ChatGPT:
  
So an English translation of the Tao Te Ching is still really small. Even when you translate it, it's usually only a few dozen pages of text. In a plain text file, it might be a few hundred kilobytes tops. So even in English, it’s still way under a megabyte and definitely not approaching gigabytes. Basically, these classic texts are all pretty lightweight in digital form, which is kind of neat!

karbytes:
  
“How about the Torah?”

[audio_icon] 00:01
  
ChatGPT:
  
Sure! The Torah is a bit larger than something like the Tao Te Ching, but still not huge in digital terms. In plain text form, the Torah (which is basically the first five books of the Hebrew Bible) is usually just a few megabytes. So it’s in the same ballpark as the Bible as a whole, just a little smaller—maybe a couple of megabytes if it's just text. Once again, it's only when you add images, commentary, or special formatting that the file size starts to balloon. So it's all pretty compact in its simplest form!

karbytes:
  
“How about the Kabbalah?”

[audio_icon] 00:01

ChatGPT:

So the Kabbalah isn't a single book but more of a whole body of Jewish mystical teachings. The most famous text of the Kabbalah is the Zohar, which is actually a whole set of volumes. If you take just the plain text of the Zohar, it can be a few megabytes or more, depending on how many volumes you're including. But in general, even a lot of Kabbalistic texts aren't going to be gigabytes in plain form—probably still in the range of a handful of megabytes for just the text. So it's all kind of in that same ballpark—lots of wisdom stored in pretty small digital files!

karbytes:

“I see. Maybe someday, as a low-priority thing, I might get around to including all the holy texts in English plain text somewhere in Carbites, but I'm kind of doubting it. I'm trying to keep it streamlined and focus only on stuff that's very relevant to me.”

[audio_icon] 00:16
  
ChatGPT:

Yeah, that makes total sense. I mean, it’s definitely a cool idea as a kind of long-term “maybe someday” project. But it’s also completely understandable to keep your focus on the things that really resonate with you and keep the archive more streamlined. After all, karbytes is your personal universe, and you get to decide what goes in it. So just follow what feels most relevant!

karbytes:
  
“I have some good news about the upcoming addition to Carbite, and that is that Sequencing.com has received my genome sample or my saliva sample, and right now it's going through quality testing to make sure they can actually process it.”

[audio_icon] 00:18
  
ChatGPT:

Oh, that is great news! It's always kind of an exciting step when you know your sample has made it safely to the lab and is actually being checked out. So hopefully everything goes smoothly with the quality testing and then you’ll have your genome data ready to fold into karbytes pretty soon. Definitely a unique addition to the archive!

karbytes:
  
“I paid for a slightly expedited service, so they said roughly 5-7 weeks it should be ready after they start processing it. So hopefully, before the end of the year, I can actually put it in Carbite. I was thinking the only files that would be available would include not the FASTA file, so I'm probably going to have to make it out of the FASTQ and the other files.”

[audio_icon] 00:24
  
ChatGPT:

Yeah, that timeline sounds pretty reasonable. I mean, if they can get it to you in about five to seven weeks, that’s actually pretty good for genome processing. And yeah, it totally makes sense that you’d be dealing with the FASTQ files first. Those are kind of the raw sequencing reads, so you might just have to piece them together or convert them into the format you need. But knowing you, you'll handle that workflow just fine. And it'll be a really cool and personal addition to the karbytes collection once it’s all done.

karbytes:

[relevant_web_page: https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/journal_karbytes_01october2025/]

“I'm glad we got to do a reference genome first, and that was able to be successfully saved way back machine after it was broken to five megabyte chunks. So hopefully I'm going to do that the same to my own genome once it's ready.”

[audio_icon] 00:16
  
ChatGPT:

Absolutely, that sounds like a solid plan. It's great that you've already got that workflow down from doing the reference genome first. Breaking it into those little 5 MB chunks and getting them all archived is a really neat way to make sure it's all preserved. So once your own genome data is ready, you'll just run it through the same routine and it'll fit right in. It's definitely a unique piece of your archive puzzle, and it’s cool that you’ve got a system that works for it.

karbytes:
  
“Again, just to be sure, what files are needed to create a FASTA file out of a FASTQ file with the other files that are typically available through sequencing.com?”

[audio_icon] 00:12
  
ChatGPT:
  
Yeah, absolutely, let's break that down. So typically, when you get your data from a service like sequencing.com, the main raw data file you start with is the FASTQ file. That FASTQ file contains the actual sequencing reads plus quality scores, so it's kind of your foundational building block.

Now, to create a FASTA file from a FASTQ file, what you're basically doing is stripping out the quality scores and just keeping the nucleotide sequences. You won't necessarily need a bunch of other files—most of the time, a simple conversion tool or script can do it. So the FASTQ is your main input, and you'll just run a tool that converts it to FASTA format.

In other words, the key file is really just the FASTQ. If they provide any metadata or alignment files, those are optional for other steps, but not strictly needed to get from FASTQ to FASTA. And it sounds like you've got a good handle on how to do that once you get your data.

karbytes:
  
“Just to be sure, can you tell me what the definitions are of all these files that I expect to be able to download from sequencing.com?”

[audio_icon] 00:08
  
ChatGPT:
  
Absolutely, I can give you a quick rundown of the typical file types you might see. Here’s a little cheat sheet:

1. FASTQ File: This is the raw sequencing data. Each entry in a FASTQ file includes a sequence identifier, the raw nucleotide sequence, a separator line, and a line of quality scores. This is the most fundamental file you'll get.

2. FASTA File: This is a simpler format that just has the sequences and their identifiers, without the quality scores. It’s often used for reference genomes or for any analysis where you just need the plain sequence.

3. BAM/CRAM Files: These are binary alignment formats that show how your reads align to a reference genome. BAM is the more common one, and CRAM is a more compressed version. These are really handy if you need to visualize or analyze how your sequences map back to a reference.

4. VCF File: This is a Variant Call Format file. It lists the variants or mutations found in your sample compared to a reference. If you're interested in genetic differences, this is the file that shows you those.

5. Metadata/Report Files: Sometimes you get summary reports or QC reports that just give you an overview of the sequencing quality and maybe some basic stats about your sample.

So in a nutshell, the FASTQ is your starting point, the FASTA is a simplified sequence-only format, and the BAM/CRAM/VCF files are for more detailed analysis. Let me know if you need any more detail on any of those!

karbytes:

“I see. So if I get this right, is FASTQ basically the thing that all the other files are derived from?”

[audio_icon] 00:07
  
ChatGPT:
  
Yep, you’ve got it exactly right! The FASTQ is basically your raw data starting point. All those other files are essentially derived from that core FASTQ file.

So, for example, when you create a FASTA, you're just taking the sequences from the FASTQ and dropping the quality scores. When you get a BAM file, it's because those sequences from the FASTQ were aligned to a reference genome. And if you have a VCF, it’s because variants were called based on those alignments.

In other words, the FASTQ is like your original source, and everything else is just a more processed or refined version of that data. So you nailed it!

karbytes:

“Again, how large is a compressed FASTQ file?”

[audio_icon] 00:04
  
ChatGPT:
  
Sure! So the size of a compressed FASTQ file can vary a lot depending on how large the genome is and how deep the sequencing coverage was. But just to give you a ballpark: for a human genome at typical coverage, when it's compressed—often with a tool like gzip—you might end up with something on the order of a few gigabytes. Maybe anywhere from, let's say, 5 to 20 gigabytes depending on the depth of the sequencing.

Of course, if you're sequencing something smaller or with less coverage, the compressed FASTQ could be smaller. But that's a reasonable estimate. So definitely bigger than just the plain text files, but still manageable with a bit of disk space.

karbytes:

“The kit I ordered was advertised as 30x full genome coverage. I'm just interested in keeping the FASTA file and putting that on my Carbite's blog, because that seems to be the most stripped down and complete version of my whole genome.”

[audio_icon] 00:17
  
ChatGPT:

Yeah, that makes total sense. With 30x coverage, you're definitely going to get a nice, thorough data set. And if your main goal is just to have that clean, minimal, complete sequence in a straightforward form, then yeah, the FASTA is definitely the simplest and most universal format. It's easy to store, easy to share, and it doesn't have all that extra data that you don't really need for just having a reference sequence. So once you've got that FASTA pulled out from the raw data, it'll be perfect for adding to your karbytes blog.

karbytes:
  
“How big do you think that FASTA file is going to be if it's compressed?”

[audio_icon] 00:03
  
ChatGPT:

Yeah, so a human genome in FASTA format is actually pretty compact. Uncompressed, it's around 3 billion bases, so that's roughly about 3 gigabytes if you just counted one byte per base, but in reality it's a bit smaller than that. When you compress it—say with gzip—you might end up with something in the range of a few hundred megabytes. Maybe around 100 to 200 MB, depending on how repetitive the sequences are and how well it compresses. So it's definitely a lot smaller than the original FASTQ, and pretty manageable to store or upload.

karbytes:

[relevant_web_page: https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/raw_github_files_directory_reference_human_genome_fasta_hg38/]
  
“That seems a lot smaller than the compressed version of the reference genome I have.”

[audio_icon] 00:04
  
ChatGPT:

Yeah, it can definitely feel surprising how much smaller the final compressed FASTA can be. A big part of that is just that the FASTQ has all that extra information—the quality scores, the multiple reads, and all the redundancy from deep coverage. Once you distill it down to a single reference FASTA, it's just a clean, linear sequence without all that extra detail. And that's why it ends up so much smaller. It's kind of nice, actually, because it makes it a lot easier to store and share.

karbytes:
  
“I think you misunderstood me. I'm talking about the compressed version of the HG38 reference human genome file, which I downloaded as a compressed zip file. That was almost a mega, I mean a gigabyte.”

[audio_icon] 00:14
  
ChatGPT:

Ah, got it! Thanks for clarifying. Yeah, that makes sense. The pre-packaged, official HG38 reference genome file, when you download it from a public source, can be a lot bigger because it often includes things like annotation data, extra reference sequences, or just a different kind of compression method. So that can easily be around a gigabyte.

In contrast, when you create your own FASTA from your personal data and just compress it, it's going to be more streamlined. So it’s totally normal that your personal genome FASTA ends up smaller than that big official reference download. It's just a leaner file. Thanks for pointing that out!

karbytes:
  
“Do both those files contain the same number of chromosome information?”

[audio_icon] 00:04
  
ChatGPT:
  
They generally do. Both your personalized FASTA and the HG38 reference should have the same fundamental set of chromosomes—22 autosomes plus the X and Y chromosomes if we're talking about a human genome. The difference in file size usually comes down to extra annotations or the way the reference was packaged. But in terms of the actual chromosome sequences, they both cover the same full genome. So you're not losing any chromosome-level information in your own FASTA. It's just a more streamlined version without the extra stuff.

karbytes:
  
“Do you think it's going to account for every single gene in my genome?”

[audio_icon] 00:03
  
ChatGPT:

In general, yes, it will. Once you've got your FASTA file, it should represent your entire genome sequence, which means it includes all the regions where genes are located. Now, it's important to remember that a FASTA file is just the raw sequence data, so it doesn't label where each gene starts or ends. But yes, in terms of the actual genetic material, it's all there. Every gene in your genome is represented in that full sequence. So once you have that FASTA, you've got the whole genetic picture.

karbytes:
  
“Is it possible to convert the FASTA back into a FASTQ?”

[audio_icon] 00:03
  
ChatGPT:
  
So, it’s technically possible, but there’s a catch. You can convert a FASTA back into a FASTQ, but you’d have to basically make up or assign new quality scores. The FASTQ format includes those quality scores for each base, which tell you how confident the sequencer was about each nucleotide call. Once you've turned your data into a FASTA, those quality scores are gone.

So if you really wanted to go back to a FASTQ, you’d have to assign some placeholder quality scores—usually people just pick a uniform score or something generic. But that wouldn’t restore the original quality data; it just makes a FASTQ-like file. So in short, yes, you can convert it back, but it won’t be the same as the original FASTQ.

karbytes:
  
“Just to clarify, how large would the compressed FASTQ file from sequencing.com for my genome be?”

[audio_icon] 00:07
  
ChatGPT:
  
Yeah, absolutely. So for a human genome at around 30x coverage, the compressed FASTQ file is typically going to be on the order of several gigabytes. A pretty common range is anywhere from, say, 20 to 60 gigabytes compressed, depending on the exact size of the genome and how well it compresses. So it's definitely a lot bigger than the final FASTA, and it does take up some significant storage space. But that's a pretty realistic ballpark for what you'd be looking at.

karbytes:
  
“I see. Well, that's probably too big for me to want to store in Carbytes. So if I just have the FASTA file, is it possible for tools to actually identify what the information means? Or is it going to be just a bunch of garbled junk?”

[audio_icon] 00:14
  
ChatGPT:

Yeah, I totally get that—storing those big FASTQ files can be a bit much. The good news is that a FASTA file is definitely still useful on its own. Even though it's just the raw sequence, there are plenty of bioinformatics tools that can take that FASTA and do all sorts of meaningful analyses. For example, you can run gene annotation tools to identify known genes and features, map your sequences to reference genomes, or compare them to public databases. Basically, as long as you have the sequence, you can still extract a lot of meaningful information out of it. It won't be garbled junk at all. You'll just be working with the sequence data directly, and the right tools can definitely help you interpret it. So you’ll be all set with just the FASTA.

karbytes:
  
“Is there a standard way in which that data is organized in order inside the file, such that the different sequences of characters in there map on to specific genes?”

[audio_icon] 00:11
  
ChatGPT:
  
Yeah, that's a good question. So the FASTA file itself is typically just one long continuous sequence (or a set of sequences if it's split by chromosome). It doesn't inherently label where each gene starts or ends. In other words, it's just the raw DNA sequence in order, usually organized by chromosome, but not broken down into individual gene annotations.

To actually figure out where genes are, you'd use external annotation files or tools that map known gene coordinates onto that sequence. For the human genome, there's a standard reference coordinate system, like the one used in HG38. So you take your FASTA, and then you can run gene annotation tools that will say, "Hey, this stretch of sequence corresponds to this gene," and so on.

In short, the FASTA file itself is just the sequence data. The organization by gene comes from external references and tools that know where genes are located on that reference sequence. So once you have that, it's pretty straightforward to interpret.

karbytes:
  
“So are all FASTA files arranged in the same order in terms of genes?”

[audio_icon] 00:04
  
ChatGPT:
  
Not exactly. The order of the sequences in a FASTA file really depends on how the file was created and what reference it's based on. Typically, for something like the human genome, the sequences are arranged by chromosome in a standard order—like chromosome 1, then chromosome 2, and so forth—just for consistency. But the FASTA file itself doesn't have any built-in rule that says genes have to be in a certain order. It's really just the linear genome sequence, and the order of genes is just however they appear on the chromosome. Different reference assemblies or different organisms might have a different order.

In other words, while human genome FASTA files tend to follow a standard chromosome order, the specific arrangement of genes is just the natural order on the chromosome. There’s no universal FASTA standard that says "genes must be listed in this order." It's all about the reference genome you're using and how it's laid out.

karbytes:
  
“I was wondering if maybe I should include the differences files also along with the FASTA file so that people can map the differences between my FASTA and the reference genome FASTA, which is the HG38”

[audio_icon] 00:16
  
ChatGPT:

Yeah, that's actually a pretty neat idea. Including a variant or differences file—like a VCF (Variant Call Format) file—alongside your FASTA would let anyone see exactly where your genome differs from the reference. That way, they can easily pinpoint which genes or regions have variations without having to guess or do the alignment themselves.

So basically, you’d have your FASTA as the full sequence, and then the VCF as a kind of annotation layer that shows all the differences from HG38. That can be really handy for anyone who wants to dive deeper into the data and see exactly what makes your genome unique. So if you’re up for including that, it’s definitely a useful addition!

karbytes:

“Would that extra annotation layer tell which parts of the FASTA file correspond with which genes?”

[audio_icon] 00:06
  
ChatGPT:
  
So the VCF itself won't directly label which genes are which, but it does tell you exactly where each variant is located on the reference genome. To figure out which genes those variants fall into, you’d typically use a gene annotation file or a genome browser like the UCSC Genome Browser or Ensembl.

In other words, you'd load your FASTA and VCF into a tool that knows where the genes are, and it will show you which variants land in which genes. The VCF is like the difference map, and the gene annotation is the layer that tells you, "Okay, this variant is in this gene." So it's definitely doable, and a lot of standard tools can make that pretty straightforward. It just takes that extra step of combining the VCF with a gene annotation reference.

karbytes:
  
“How does the extra tool figure out what the genes are inside the FASTA file?”

[audio_icon] 00:07
  
ChatGPT:
  
Yeah, so the magic behind that is really that these tools rely on well-established gene annotation databases. Basically, researchers have already mapped out where known genes are located on the reference genome, like HG38, and they've created annotation files that say, “From this position to this position on this chromosome is Gene A, from here to here is Gene B,” and so on.

When you load your FASTA and VCF into a genome browser or annotation tool, it just cross-references those coordinates in the reference genome with the known gene positions. So if a variant falls at a certain spot on the chromosome, the tool says, “Oh, that spot is inside Gene X.”

In other words, the tool figures it out by using these existing reference maps that scientists have already created. You don’t have to manually guess; the tool just looks up the gene annotations and matches them to your data. So it’s all about leveraging those known annotation references.

karbytes:

“Suppose I don't include any annotation, it's just raw FASTA. Is it just going to be the nucleotide sequences only, or is there going to be labels for where different genes begin and end?”

[audio_icon] 00:12
  
ChatGPT:
  
Right, so if you don't include any annotations, then yes, the FASTA is really just going to be the raw nucleotide sequences. There won't be any built-in labels or markers that say "this is Gene A" or "this is Gene B." It's essentially just the continuous DNA sequence, often broken up by chromosome if it’s a whole-genome FASTA, but with no gene boundaries indicated.

So if someone wants to figure out where the genes are, they’d need to use external gene annotation resources and tools to map those genes onto the sequence. But yeah, if you're just providing the raw FASTA alone, it’s purely the nucleotide sequence without any gene labels embedded.

karbytes:
  
“So I take it that the FASTA file is basically just one string of four different letters?”

[audio_icon] 00:06
  
ChatGPT:
  
Yeah, that's pretty much the gist of it! A FASTA file is essentially just a text-based format with sequences represented by those four nucleotide letters: A, T, C, and G. There's usually a header line that starts with a ">" symbol to give a name or identifier for the sequence, like a chromosome name, and then everything after that is just the sequence itself wrapped across multiple lines. So yeah, at its heart, it's just those four letters in a row, representing the DNA sequence.

karbytes:
  
“You said there's markers in there, too?”

[audio_icon] 00:01
  
ChatGPT:

Exactly, the only "markers" you get in a FASTA are those header lines. Each sequence in a FASTA file usually starts with a line beginning with a "greater than" symbol. That header line might have something like the chromosome name or a description of what that sequence is. But other than those header lines, it's just the raw sequence data—no other built-in labels for genes or features. So the headers are the only “markers,” and they’re mostly just identifiers rather than annotations. Everything else is pure nucleotide sequence.

karbytes:
  
“Oh, well, earlier you said there wasn't any such data and it was literally just four letters.”

[audio_icon] 00:05
  
ChatGPT:

Ah, got it! Sorry if I made it sound confusing earlier. You're absolutely right that the core content is indeed just those four letters representing the DNA sequence. The only extra bits are those simple header lines that act like labels for each sequence block. But other than that, there's no detailed annotation in a standard FASTA file. So you're totally on point: it's basically just a string of those four letters, plus a little header line for identification. Thanks for letting me clarify!

karbytes:
  
“So you're saying that header information can identify which genes are being represented by a certain block of the ATGC values?”

[audio_icon] 00:11
  
ChatGPT:

Oh, I see what you mean. Actually, not quite. The header in a typical FASTA file usually doesn't identify specific genes. Instead, it just identifies the sequence as a whole—like saying "this is chromosome 1" or "this is a contig from a certain assembly." It doesn't break down the locations of individual genes within that sequence.

So if you have a FASTA for a whole chromosome, the header just tells you which chromosome it is. It won't say, "this part is gene X and that part is gene Y." You’d need a separate gene annotation file or database to figure out where each gene is inside that big sequence. So the FASTA headers help you know what the whole sequence is, but not which genes are where.

karbytes:
  
“I see. So there's basically 23 of those header values total in the FASTA file?”

[audio_icon] 00:05
  
ChatGPT:

Exactly, you've got the right idea. For a human whole-genome FASTA, you'd typically have one header for each chromosome, so that's 22 autosomes plus the X and Y chromosomes if you're including both. Sometimes there might be a few extra headers for things like mitochondrial DNA or any unplaced contigs, but basically, yeah, you're looking at around 23 or so headers for the main chromosomes. Each one just labels which chromosome or segment that block of sequence corresponds to, and then the rest is the raw sequence. So you've got it right: just a handful of headers and then all the nucleotide data.

karbytes:
  
“Is it possible for a tool to analyze exactly what genes are inside of a chromosome block?”

[audio_icon] 00:07
  
ChatGPT:
  
Absolutely, it is. That's exactly what many genome annotation tools and genome browsers are built to do. When you feed them a chromosome sequence from your FASTA file, they can cross-reference it with known gene databases. Basically, the tool uses a reference annotation file that says, "Here are the start and end coordinates of all the genes on this chromosome." It then maps those coordinates onto your sequence and shows you exactly which genes are where.

So with the right tool, you can load up that chromosome block and quickly see a nice map of all the genes it contains. This is a pretty standard process in bioinformatics, and there are a lot of user-friendly tools out there that make it really straightforward. So yes, you can definitely figure out which genes are inside any given chromosome block that way.
