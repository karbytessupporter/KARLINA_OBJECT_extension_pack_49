<p>RECURSIVE_SIMULATION_OF_THE_COSMOS_CONCEPT</p>
<p>The purpose of this journal entry is to clarify my thoughts pertaining to the subject matter expressed in the following two web pages (especially web_page_0):</p>
<p>web_page_0: <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/recursive_generative_void_illustration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/recursive_generative_void_illustration/</a></p>
<p>web_page_1: <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/knowledge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/knowledge/</a></p>

<p>Let C represent the entire cosmos.</p>
<p>By definition, there is nothing outside of C because C literally encompasses everything (including nothing).</p>
<p>Let U represent a particular subset of C such that U is the physical universe in which this web page is being accessed right now by your <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">frame of reference</a>.</p>
<p>Let H represent a particular piece of computational hardware which exists in U such that H encompasses a finite (yet growing) allocation of matter and <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/triangle_graphing_two/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spatial</a> volume (to accommodate increasing data <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth_(computing)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bandwidth</a>).</p>
<p>Let S represent a particular piece of software running on H such that S attempts to represent C as completely and as accurately as possible.</p>
<p>Suppose, right now (in relation to your frame of reference), S is only attempting to simulate a relatively tiny part of U: the spatial volume where H currently exists and every atom and subatomic particle within that spatial volume at this time.</p>
<p>There is supposedly already an insurmountable temporal gap between how each of the particles of H are configured at time t and how the digital clones of each of those particles are configured at time t inside of S due to signal <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propagation_delay" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">propagation delay</a> (such that S at time t attempting to clone H at time t is algebraically modeled as S(t) ~= H(t &#8211; x) where x is a positive amount of time).</p>
<p>Also, because attempting to measure the state of a subatomic particle in H at time t using a physical instrument in U inevitably displaces (via <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_decoherence" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">quantum decoherence</a>) energy and/or matter inside of U such that the resulting observation of that particle (as rendered by S at time t + x) is possibly (and likely) a different configuration of that particle than how that particle actually is instantiated in H at time t + x.</p>
<p>Suppose that, in order to make S more efficient (but less accurate), S is simplified in order to be functional enough to render H in as minimal detail as is needed to depict all of H&#8217;s functional components (down to the level of individual <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">transistors</a> and other elementary circuit components (but not all the way down to subatomic particles)). Then S would appear to be a digital clone of H while H is powered off.</p>
<p>Suppose that S is made more complex by adding the detail of the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">voltage</a> state of each transistor of H (as measured by hardware which is inside of U but not necessarily also inside of H). Then S could technically model itself being run (albeit with inevitable propagation delay). In other words, S(t + x + y) ~= H(t) + S(t + x) where y is a positive amount of <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/count_down_timer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">time</a>.</p>
