<p>It could be that, pragmatically speaking, there is an upper limit to how much information I can personally memorize (even with the use of external memory devices and other neural augmentation hardware). If that is the case, I may need to overwrite some of my memories with new memories in order to continue &#8220;learning&#8221;. In that case, there would be some memories I am hoping to always keep in tact within my personal nervous system and/or peripheral memory devices: the unabridged (and latest version of the) digital file collection named <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_code_possibly_stops_growing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">karbytes</a> (or, at the very least, the portion of that digital file collection referred to as karbytes_kernel (which is designed to be small enough to easily fit onto a 25 gigabyte M_DISC such that most of that 25 gigabyte allotment can be used to store other karbytes data)).</p>
<p>An outline of an 01_OCTOBER_2025 version of karbytes_kernel is available at the following Uniform Resource Locator:</p>
<p><a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_49/main/karbytes_kernel_01october2025_contents.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_49/main/karbytes_kernel_01october2025_contents.txt</a></p>
<p>Basically, karbytes_kernel is designed to represent the most essential data of karbytes and which is present on every 25 M_DISC backup of karbytes (following the completion of the version of karbytes named karbytes2025_22 whose contents are enumerated on the web page at the following Uniform Resource Locator):</p>
<p><a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/mdisc_karbytes2025_22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/mdisc_karbytes2025_22/</a></p>
<p>The data on karbytes M_DISCs which contain either karbytes2025_22 or a post-2025 version of karbytes will contain some version of karbytes_kernel (though, generally speaking, karbytes_kernel is supposed to be relatively immutable). Data on those discs which is not classified as being part of any version of karbytes_kernel is considered to be worthy of archiving for historical significance to karbytes or for entertainment purposes. Meanwhile, karbytes_kernel data is considered to be the most compressed version of karbytes available and data which can be used to &#8220;reconstruct&#8221; karbytes to some extent (but not necessarily to the extent that an exact replica of the most recently created unabridged karbytes version is created from karbytes_kernel).</p>
