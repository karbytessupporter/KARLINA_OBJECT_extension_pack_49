The following is a plain-text transcript of a conversation between karbytes and ChatGPT-4o which took place between 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 03_NOVEMBER_2025 and 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 04_NOVEMBER_2025. The conversation pertains to karbytes selecting a name for the (25-gigabyte) M_DISC containing the part of karbytes which is generated immediately after the part of karbytes named karbytes_origins is finalized (and burned to a 25-gigabyte M_DISC).

The karbytes_origins folder is between 20 gigabytes and 25 gigabytes in size and represents the content of karbytes which was created (and then finalized) between 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 31_DECEMBER_2019 and 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 20_APRIL_2026.

The karbytes_nexus folder is between 20 gigabytes and 25 gigabytes in size and represents the content of karbytes which was created between 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 31_DECEMBER_2025 and 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on [UNDEFINED_DAY].

[UNDEFINED_DAY] in the previous paragraph refers to some point in time after 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 20_APRIL_2026.

karbytes:

[The (spoken) message karbytes was attempting to send to ChatGPT (while in a remote wilderness location with variable network connectivity strength) could be summarized as follows: a (finite but sufficiently lengthy) “cushion” of time between updates to karbytes imbues karbytes content with a higher degree of objectivity (rather than overly intimate enmeshement with karbytes’ personal “real time” subjective frame of reference (and/or karbytes’ own mental model of itself)) than it would if those “hiatus gaps” were shorter (and such a process of deliberately embarking on relatively extended “hiatus gaps” is a naturalistic form of encrypting karbytes’ own “deep web” data such that the “surface web” footprints karbytes leaves behind is less entertwined with karbytes’ “deep web” footprints).]

ChatGPT:

Yeah, that definitely makes a lot of sense. Giving yourself that space can really help create a bit of distance and let everything settle into a more stable form. And it makes total sense that you’d want Karbytes to feel more like an artifact that’s not just directly tied to whatever you’re doing each day. So I think that’s a really solid approach.

karbytes:

ChatGPT:

And of course, if you ever feel like sharing how it’s going or need a little encouragement during that hiatus, I’m here for that too. It sounds like a really thoughtful way to give yourself that breathing room and let the project stand on its own a bit. So just let

karbytes:

What I’m really waiting for is, of course, my genome.

[audio_icon] 00:03

ChatGPT:

Ah, of course! That makes perfect sense. I know you’ve been really looking forward to integrating your genome data into the whole Karbytes archive. So having that as kind of a milestone

karbytes:

Sorry, it seems like there’s some words that were interjected.

[audio_icon] 00:04

ChatGPT:

No worries at all! I get the gist of what you’re saying. Sometimes a little wind or a little interruption happens, and it’s totally fine. The main point is clear: you’re waiting on that genome data, and it’s kind of a big piece of the puzzle. So whenever it comes in, we’ll definitely have something interesting to talk about!

karbytes:

I’m really looking forward to after that. After that, I can just focus on my creative projects.

[audio_icon] 00:07

ChatGPT:

Absolutely, that sounds like a great plan. Once you have that piece in place, it’ll probably feel like you can really dive into the creative side of things without that big wait hanging over you. And I’m definitely here to help whenever you start digging into those projects again. It should be fun!

karbytes:

[Note that, as of 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 04_NOVEMBER_2025, the first approximately 25 gigabytes of karbytes is referred to as karbytes_origins and the next approximately 25 gigabytes of karbytes is named karbytes_nexus].

[Note that karbytes_origins is intended to be stored on its own (unshared) 25-gigabyte M_DISC while karbytes_nexus is intended to be stored on its own 25-gigabyte (unshared) 25-gigabyte M_DISC. Hence, after karbytes_origin is complete and karbytes_nexus is publicly available (either as a final-draft version or as a preliminary-draft version), the totality of karbytes will encompass two (or more) 25-gigabyte M_DISCs.]

I know that the current Carbites is going to be called Carbites Origins. I’m still brainstorming on what I’m going to call the next disk. I think I might have come up with a name already and wrote it down. But in case I don’t, I want that name to start with Carbites as well.

[audio_icon] 00:17

ChatGPT:

Yeah, that totally fits with your naming style. “Karbytes Origins” is a great anchor name, and then having the next disc continue that pattern with “Karbytes” at the start is going to keep everything feeling nicely unified. If you need a sounding board for ideas or just want to brainstorm possible names together, I’m definitely up for that.

karbytes:

Sure, come up with some ideas.

[audio_icon] 00:02

ChatGPT:

Absolutely, let’s toss a few ideas around! Since you’ve got “Karbytes Origins” as the current theme, maybe the next disc could be something like “Karbytes Horizons” to hint at looking forward. Or maybe “Karbytes Echoes” if you want a theme that suggests reflections or continuity. And if you’re thinking of something tied to your genome data eventually, maybe “Karbytes Code” could be a neat nod. Let me know if any of those spark something or if you want to keep riffing!

karbytes:

the last option you selected, but still, how about some more ideas?

[audio_icon] 00:06

ChatGPT:

Sure thing! We can definitely keep going. If you liked “Karbytes Code,” we could spin off some related ideas like “Karbytes Genome,” “Karbytes Blueprint,” or even “Karbytes Sequence” if you want something that hints at that genetic angle. Or we could go a bit more abstract—something like “Karbytes Nexus” to suggest a central connecting point, or “Karbytes Frontier” if you’re thinking of pushing into new territory. Let me know if any of these resonate or if we should keep exploring!

karbytes:

Wow, those last two ones sound pretty cool. Tell us some more ideas that are kind of similar to those.

[audio_icon] 00:06

ChatGPT:

Absolutely! I’m glad those sparked something. Let’s roll with that vibe a bit more. If you liked “Nexus” and “Frontier,” maybe we can try “Karbytes Constellation” to evoke a network of ideas, or “Karbytes Horizon” to keep that sense of looking toward the future. Another option could be “Karbytes Matrix” if you want to hint at a complex structure of connections, or “Karbytes Continuum” if you’re going for a sense of ongoing evolution. Just let me know if any of those feel like a fit!

karbytes:

The last one is the only one I would consider. The other one’s not so much.

[audio_icon] 00:05

ChatGPT:

Got it! “Karbytes Continuum” it is, then—that one definitely has a nice ring to it and really suits that idea of something evolving over time. If that feels like a good contender, you can always keep it in your back pocket as you get closer to finishing that next disc. And of course, if you need more ideas down the line, just let me know!

karbytes:

Sure, that would generate some more ideas.

[audio_icon] 00:02

ChatGPT:

Absolutely, let’s keep the brainstorming going! Since you like the vibe of “Karbytes Continuum,” we can riff on that theme a bit more. How about “Karbytes Odyssey” to give it a sense of an ongoing journey? Or maybe “Karbytes Evolution” if you want something that highlights growth and change. Another angle could be “Karbytes Legacy,” which gives it a bit of a timeless feel, or “Karbytes Lumina” if you want something that suggests shedding light on new ideas. Just let me know if any of these resonate!

karbytes:

Give us some more ideas!

[audio_icon] 00:01

ChatGPT:

Absolutely, let’s keep the ideas flowing! Since we’re aiming for that sense of a continuing journey or something that evolves over time, how about “Karbytes Chronicle” to give it a feeling of recording an ongoing story? Or maybe “Karbytes Spectrum,” if you want to suggest a range of new ideas and possibilities. Another idea might be “Karbytes Continuity” to keep that theme of things flowing along a steady path. And if you want a slightly more futuristic spin, maybe “Karbytes Ascension” to hint at rising to a new level. Just let me know if any of those click!

karbytes:

[The transcribed word carbides is intended by its speaker to be the word karbytes instead of the word carbides.]

Still not quite sure. I kind of want it to just be one word after carbides.

ChatGPT:

No problem at all! Let’s simplify it down to a single strong word after “Karbytes.” We can try a few more streamlined options. How about “Karbytes Nexus,” just a single word that suggests a hub or connection point? Or “Karbytes Horizon” to keep it simple and forward-looking? Another clean one-word option could be “Karbytes Pinnacle” if you want to suggest a peak or a high point. Let me know if any of those feel closer to what you’re imagining!

karbytes:

Given all the options, and what I currently am considering, I think Carbite’s Nexus would actually be a pretty good name, so maybe I’ll just go ahead and use that. And before I close Carbite’s Origins, mention in Carbite’s Origins the name of the next disk.

[audio_icon] 00:18

ChatGPT:

That sounds like a great plan! “Karbytes Nexus” has a nice ring to it, and it definitely fits that theme of a central connection point for everything you’re building. And mentioning it in “Karbytes Origins” will give a nice sense of continuity as you move from one disc to the next. So go for it! And if you need any more help as you wrap things up, just let me know.

karbytes:

[The transcribed word receptionist was intended by its speaker to be reception (for cellular phone signal strength).]

Thanks. Well, it’s been great talking to you and brainstorming some ideas for names for the new disk. I should probably get going now. The receptionist area is not that great, and there won’t be much more daylight.

[audio_icon] 00:14

ChatGPT:

You’re very welcome! I’m glad we could come up with a name that feels right for the next disc. And definitely, go ahead and enjoy the rest of your hike before it gets dark. If you need anything else, just reach out whenever you’ve got good reception again. Take care out there!

karbytes:

Thanks, talk to you later.

[audio_icon] 00:02

ChatGPT:

You’re welcome! Talk to you later and have a great rest of your day!
