<p><strong>PART_0: What is karbytes?</strong></p>
<p>The collection of public web-hosted files named <strong>karbytes</strong> is defined explicitly in the web page at the following Uniform Resource Locator: <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_code_possibly_stops_growing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_code_possibly_stops_growing/</a></p>
<p>The totality of karbytes is encompassed by the list of &#8220;micro directories&#8221; in the following singular <strong>&#8220;macro directory&#8221;</strong> list at the following Uniform Resource Locator: <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/raw_github_files_macro_directory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/raw_github_files_macro_directory/</a></p>
<p>The karbytes-specific term <strong>&#8220;micro directory&#8221;</strong> is defined explicitly in the web page at the following Uniform Resource Locator: <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/micro_directory_definition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/micro_directory_definition/</a></p>

<p><strong>PART_1: How is karbytes archived?</strong></p>
<p>As of 17_OCTOBER_2025 at 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time, all karbytes GitHub repositories which do not have a date-stamped .zip filename (listed in the latest <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/mdisc_karbytes2025_22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">M_DISC catalog</a> of all karbytes GitHub repository .zip file downloads) are considered to be immutable and, hence, are expected to remain frozen as historical snapshots. <u>Any repository whose .zip filename includes a timestamp is considered open to ongoing modifications until the date component of that file name is removed.</u></p>
<p>To maintain archival integrity, <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_unique_identity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kar Beringer (i.e. karbytes)</a> (re)generates a checksum value for each .zip file using a <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_49/main/print_folder_checksums.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dedicated Python script</a>. Those <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_49/main/karbytes2025_22_checksums.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">checksum records</a> will be stored in all current and future karbytes GitHub repositories after 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 17_OCTOBER_2025.</p>
<p>Finally, it should be noted that only karbytes (i.e. Kar Beringer) is authorized to make any modifications to the karbytes file collection. <u>If no authorized changes are made to those files for more than ten consecutive years, then it can be safely assumed (by <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_code_possibly_stops_growing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">karbytes&#8217; decree</a>) that the official karbytes file collection is entirely and permantently in an immutable configuration</u>.</p>
<p>(Note that a time-stamped .zip file in this context might look something like <strong>KARBYTES_FOR_LIFE_BLOG-main_[undefined_day].zip</strong> or <strong>KARBYTES_FOR_LIFE_BLOG-main_31december2025.zip</strong> but not like KARBYTES_FOR_LIFE_BLOG-main.zip. <u>The time-stamp component of the file name is always to the right of the &#8220;-main&#8221; component and to the left of the &#8220;.zip&#8221; component</u>).</p>
