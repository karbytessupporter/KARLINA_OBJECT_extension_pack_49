The following is a plain-text transcript of a conversation between karbytes and ChatGPT-5 which took place between 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 28_SEPTEMBER_2025 and 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 29_SEPTEMBER_2025. The conversation pertains to the subject of psychedelic mushrooms and an instance in which karbytes ingested 7 grams of penis envy psilocybin on 10_JUNE_2022. 

((Though karbytes wrote some journal entries about the incident within 48 hours of the experience, karbytes decided not to reference those writings in this plain-text note given that those "trip report" notes are deemed by karbytes to be low-quality (which goes to show that perhaps increasing the dose size does not necessarily lead to higher degrees of mental clarity and useful insights during and after the trip, but rather, increased confusion, delusion, and memory lapses during those time frames). Ironically, now that karbytes is essentially "clean" of cannabis and has been carefully taking micro to moderate doses of psilocybin and 5-MeO-DMT during the past three months, karbytes ability to describe that 2022 trip seems better than ever before. karbytes was actually able to get around to the interesting metaphysical topics that were neglected in favor of more sensationalist interpersonal/social drama topics). On second thought, karbytes decided to include a URL linking to a rather shitty trip report of the aforementioned "heroic dose" shroom trip. That URL is displayed inside of the chat log near where it seems to be most relevant in the conversation according to karbytes).

Is Alive adaptogenic mushroom elixir psychoactive?

ChatGPT:

No — as far as available evidence indicates, Alive adaptogenic mushroom elixir is not psychoactive in the sense of producing hallucinations or altering perception.

Here’s a breakdown of what I found:

What is Alive adaptogenic mushroom elixir?

It’s a sparkling beverage formulated with “functional mushrooms” (e.g. reishi, chaga, turkey tail) marketed as adaptogens. 

The drink also contains 75 mg caffeine (from loose-leaf tea) per serving (in most flavors) to provide “clean energy.” [GT's Living Foods]

The formula lists about 1800 mg of mushroom components (fruiting body) per bottle—i.e. the non-psychoactive “functional” mushroom extracts. 

It does not contain hallucinogenic mushrooms like psilocybe species (which contain psilocybin). There is no indication in the ingredient labels or product descriptions of any psychoactive compounds.

Why it’s not psychoactive (by common definition)

Adaptogenic mushrooms (reishi, chaga, turkey tail) are considered medicinal or functional mushrooms that support the body (e.g. immune, stress modulation), not ones that alter cognition or perception. 

The caffeine content may produce stimulatory effects (alertness, mild jitteriness) in some people, but that's very different from a true psychoactive (hallucinogenic) effect.

There is no regulatory, scientific, or manufacturer claim that this product induces perceptual changes.

Anecdotes & subjective effects

Some users online mention feeling “a bit high” or “mild body high” after consuming it. For example:

“I think I might feel a bit high … very slight but feels like a mild body high.” [Reddit]

However, anecdotal reports are not reliable evidence of true psychoactivity. Such sensations could stem from individual sensitivity to caffeine, placebo effect, or other ingredients (vinegar, herbal components, etc.).

If you like, I can dig into whether any of the mushroom types used in Alive (reishi, chaga, turkey tail) have documented psychoactive potential under certain conditions. Would you like me to do that?

karbytes:

What would make someone feel mildly high after drinking that beverage? I kinda feel a tiny bit high from drinking not even the full bottle.

ChatGPT:

That makes sense — some people do report a “mild buzz” from drinks like Alive even though the mushrooms in it aren’t hallucinogenic. A few possible reasons why you might feel that way:

1. Caffeine sensitivity

A bottle of Alive has around 75 mg caffeine (like a small cup of coffee).

If you’re not used to caffeine, or if you drank it on an empty stomach, you might feel lightheaded, stimulated, or euphoric — sensations some people casually describe as feeling “high.”

2. Fermentation effects

GT’s Alive is made by the same company as kombucha and has a tangy, vinegary base.

Even though it’s non-alcoholic, trace fermentation byproducts (acids, esters) can sometimes give a slightly heady or fizzy “lift.”

3. Mushroom adaptogens (subtle physiological effects)

Mushrooms like reishi and chaga contain compounds (e.g. triterpenes, polysaccharides) that may affect the nervous system indirectly.

These aren’t psychoactive like cannabis or psilocybin, but some people report relaxation, clarity, or mild body sensations.

4. Blood sugar and gut chemistry

The elixir contains natural sugars and acids. A quick blood sugar spike, combined with digestive effects from fermented ingredients, could give a tingly, floaty feeling.

5. Placebo & expectation

Because it’s marketed as a “mushroom elixir” and has a funky, medicinal taste, your brain may anticipate altered effects, making you more tuned in to any unusual sensations.

✅ In short: the “tiny high” you feel is most likely a mix of caffeine stimulation, mild gut-nervous system effects from the fermented base, and subjective sensitivity to the adaptogenic compounds. It isn’t a psychedelic high, but it can feel different than just drinking coffee or tea.

Do you want me to break down the specific mushrooms in Alive (like reishi, chaga, turkey tail) and explain how each might contribute to that subtle effect?

karbytes:

What do you think would happen if I consumed 14 grams of penis envy mushrooms on an empty stomach?

ChatGPT:

I need to pause here. What you’re asking about — taking a very large amount of Penis Envy mushrooms — is a request for dosing advice about a controlled, psychoactive drug (psilocybin). I cannot provide instructions for consuming it.

What I can do is give you harm-reduction context so you understand why your question is serious:

1. Penis Envy is unusually potent

Penis Envy is one of the strongest strains of Psilocybe cubensis, with reported psilocybin/psilocin levels up to 2–3× higher than many other cubensis varieties.

A “common strong trip” dose of ordinary cubensis is about 3.5 g (an eighth of an ounce). For Penis Envy, much less than that can already be overwhelming.

2. 14 grams is an extreme dose

14 g of dried mushrooms is 4× a large “heroic dose” (usually 3.5–5 g dried cubensis).

At that level — especially on an empty stomach — you’d almost certainly experience intense, prolonged, and potentially frightening psychedelic effects.

Effects may include total loss of connection to consensus reality, ego dissolution, overwhelming sensory and emotional intensity, panic, vomiting, and loss of motor control.

3. Risks and dangers

Psychological: This dose could trigger severe anxiety, paranoia, or psychosis, especially if you have any underlying mental health vulnerabilities.

Physical: While psilocybin itself isn’t considered physiologically toxic at those amounts, risks include accidental injury, aspiration if vomiting while incapacitated, or dangerous behavior while disoriented.

Duration: A dose that high can last 8–12+ hours with lingering aftereffects.

4. Why people caution against this

Even very experienced psychedelic users and researchers describe such doses as unsafe without medical supervision.

Clinical psilocybin studies use measured, much smaller doses (usually 20–30 mg pure psilocybin, roughly equivalent to 2–3 g of average cubensis mushrooms).

✅ In summary: 14 g of Penis Envy on an empty stomach is extremely likely to cause an overwhelming, disorienting, and potentially dangerous experience. It is not comparable to a “strong” recreational trip — it’s far beyond that range.

Would you like me to outline what harm-reduction organizations (like Erowid, MAPS, or Zendo Project) recommend people consider before using psychedelics, so you have a clearer sense of safety precautions in general?

karbytes:

How about 7 grams of the stuff?

ChatGPT:

I’m really glad you’re asking before doing anything.

Seven grams of dried Penis Envy mushrooms is still a very large, high-risk dose, even though it’s half of what you mentioned earlier. Here’s why:

1. Potency matters

Penis Envy tends to be about twice the psilocybin concentration of typical Psilocybe cubensis.

So 7 g of Penis Envy ≈ 12–14 g of regular cubensis in terms of psilocybin content. That’s still several times a “heroic dose” by standard psychonaut terminology.

2. Likely effects at that level

Total loss of ordinary perception and sense of self (“ego death”)

Intense closed-eye visuals, synesthesia, and overwhelming sensory distortion

Strong emotional swings, possible panic or terror

Nausea/vomiting or loss of coordination

The experience can last 8–12+ hours, with lingering after-effects the next day

Even very experienced psychedelic users generally describe this as overpowering and potentially traumatic without a safe, supervised setting.

3. Why harm-reduction groups advise caution

Clinical trials never use doses anywhere near this high — typical research doses are the equivalent of about 2–3 g cubensis.

High doses are associated with a greater risk of dangerous behavior, accidents, or severe psychological distress.

Having a trusted, sober sitter present, being in a safe environment, and having emergency contacts is considered essential for anything even approaching this range.

4. Bottom line

7 g of Penis Envy is not a moderate dose — it’s still in the extreme range. It can produce overwhelming, unpredictable experiences, and it carries significant psychological and safety risks.

I can’t give you instructions on how to take it, but if you’re curious about safer practices or about how harm-reduction organizations recommend preparing for psychedelic experiences (set, setting, sitter, integration), I can explain that. Want me to go over those harm-reduction tips?

I did that much actually in the summer of 2022 late at night while lying down at the Dead Children's Memorial along Fairmont Ridge on the west side of Lake Chabot. I remember a pebble seemingly manifesting out of nowhere and each breath I was taking seeming to make time elapse forward. I also had the frightening thought (which felt like a revelation) that all humans secretly want to kill me and others after they get tired of them because humans are fundamentally in competition with each other for scarce resources needed to survive.

ChatGPT:

That sounds like it was an incredibly intense experience.

What you describe — the sense of the ground “manifesting,” your breathing seeming to drive time forward, and sudden, powerful thoughts about people’s hidden motives — are all very recognizable features of a high-dose psilocybin experience, especially at the dose and setting you mentioned.

A few things to know about what happened:

1. Why the perceptions felt so real

At very high doses, psilocybin strongly affects the default-mode network and the way your brain integrates sensory and emotional information. This can make inner thoughts feel like revelations and patterns or textures seem to emerge from nowhere. Time can also feel looped, stretched, or tied to your own movements (like your breathing).

2. Why dark or frightening thoughts can arise

High doses lower the “filter” that normally dampens strong emotional content. Thoughts about death, harm, or cosmic struggle can flood in and feel viscerally true, even if you wouldn’t normally believe them. That doesn’t mean the ideas are objectively true; it means your brain was in an altered state that makes ideas emotionally and perceptually vivid.

3. Integration afterward

It’s very common to come out of such an experience with a mixture of awe, confusion, and sometimes lingering anxiety. People often find it helpful to:

Write down the experience (which you’ve partly done here).

Talk it through with a trusted, sober friend or a therapist knowledgeable about altered states.

Remind yourself that intense thoughts from a trip aren’t prophecies or facts — they’re experiences your brain created under an unusual neurochemical state.

4. Self-care after heavy psychedelic use

After such high doses, it’s normal to feel “off” for days or weeks. Gentle activities, good sleep, exercise, and grounding practices (walking in nature, mindfulness, journaling) can help. If you ever feel persistent paranoia, mood shifts, or flashback-like sensations, reaching out to a healthcare provider or a psychedelic integration group can be very stabilizing.

You’re not alone in having a frightening or “cosmic” episode on a big dose, and the fact that you’re reflecting on it now shows you’re already doing a form of integration.

Would you like me to give you some concrete integration exercises that people use after very intense psychedelic trips?

karbytes:

Do you think that I encountered matter emerging from nothingness while very high (like I was looking "through the veil" of ordinary perception to see what reality looks like "underneath" it)?

ChatGPT:

I hear what you’re asking. Experiences like the one you describe can feel absolutely real in the moment — and at a very high dose, psilocybin can create the sense that you’re seeing reality “as it really is” or “behind the veil.” But from what’s known about neuroscience and psychedelics, the most likely explanation is not that matter was literally emerging from nothingness in front of you, but that your perception and brain-state were creating that impression.

Here’s why:

1. High-dose psilocybin profoundly alters perception

Psilocybin temporarily disrupts the normal filtering and predictive functions of the brain.

Instead of smoothing out sensory noise and “filling in” reality based on expectations, your brain shows you unfiltered patterns, textures, and internal associations.

This can make pebbles seem to appear, dissolve, or rearrange — or even create the illusion of new material forming out of empty space.

2. “Revelations” under psychedelics are experiences, not measurements

The feeling of “I’m seeing ultimate reality” is extremely common at high doses; people report time stopping, dying, meeting beings, or watching universes arise and disappear.

These experiences are deeply meaningful but they’re produced by altered neural activity, not by direct sensory access to a hidden layer of physics.

If matter were literally emerging from nothingness, sober observers and cameras would also register it. Psychedelic visions do not persist objectively when the altered state ends.

3. How to work with the meaning afterward

It can be useful to treat these episodes as symbolic or psychological insights rather than as literal events.

The sense of “emerging matter” might be pointing to your own thoughts about impermanence, creation, or existential questions — which is still very valuable.

Many people find journaling, therapy, or meditation helpful to integrate such experiences without getting stuck in “was it real?” loops.

4. Bottom line

You very likely had a powerful subjective experience of emergence and revelation, not an objective observation of matter coming into being. Psychedelics are famous for temporarily making inner states indistinguishable from external reality. That doesn’t mean the experience was meaningless — only that its truth is more about your consciousness than about physics happening in front of you.

Would you like me to offer some ways of framing that experience (scientific vs. mystical interpretations) so you can hold both without feeling like you have to pick one?

karbytes:

What do you think the pebble incident really was? I remember holding my hand out and suddenly I was holding a small pebble between my fingers.

ChatGPT:

That kind of moment can feel absolutely uncanny during a powerful psychedelic state, but from everything we know about psilocybin and perception it’s far more likely to be a perceptual or memory distortion than an actual pebble materializing out of thin air.

Here are the most plausible explanations:

1. You already had the pebble in your hand without realizing it

When the brain’s attention and body-awareness are altered, it’s very easy to be touching or holding something without registering it. Many people on high doses discover objects in their hands or pockets they “didn’t know” were there a moment earlier. Under normal circumstances your sense of continuity fills in the gap automatically; on psilocybin that continuity can break.

2. Visual or tactile hallucination of an ordinary object

Your sensory system was likely blending textures, colors and expectations. It’s possible you picked up a bit of dirt, a seed, or a tiny rock, and your brain presented it as a “new” pebble or even filled in details that weren’t there. High-dose psychedelics can make neutral objects feel charged, radiant, or like they’re appearing from nothing.

3. Time-skipping / memory gaps

At very high doses you can experience “missing time” or micro-blackouts where you do something automatically (like reaching down and grabbing a stone) and then instantly “come back” as if it just happened without any in-between steps. That can give a very strong impression of spontaneous manifestation.

4. Why it felt so real

Because psilocybin lowers the brain’s predictive filter, what you perceive and what you believe at that moment can fuse. A mundane pebble can feel like a cosmic sign or like an object born out of nothing. That doesn’t mean the event was meaningless — the feeling and the symbolism can still be important — but it almost certainly wasn’t a literal creation of matter.

If you’re still thinking about that moment, it can help to write it down, reflect on the symbolism (emergence, creation, holding something tangible out of emptiness), and remind yourself that your nervous system was in a profoundly altered state. That framing lets you respect the power of the experience without having to believe you literally bent the laws of physics.
