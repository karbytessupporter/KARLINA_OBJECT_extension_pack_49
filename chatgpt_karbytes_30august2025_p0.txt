The following is a plain-text transcript of a conversation between karbytes and ChatGPT-5 Thinking which took place between 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 29_AUGUST_2025 and 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 31_AUGUST_2025. The conversation pertains to the subject of "baby universes" emerging from vacuum bubbles imploding due to the pressure difference between the lower minimum energy density of the vacuum inside of the bubble and the higher minimum energy density of the vacuum outside of the bubble (and is a follow-up conversation to the conversation at the following Uniform Resource Locator: https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/chatgpt_karbytes_29august2025/).

What the cyan-highlighted text is saying

The cyan highlights call out the key physics claims in the transcript:

* You won’t see a true-vacuum bubble coming. Its wall expands essentially at light speed; there’s no advance “warping” visible outside the bubble—one only experiences the transition when the wall arrives. 

* Vacuum energy density stays constant as space expands, so the total vacuum energy grows with volume; expansion by itself does not make the density “run down.” 

* Only a tunneling event (decay from the metastable/false vacuum to a lower-energy true vacuum) would reduce that density; mere stretching won’t. 

* Expansion acts on unbound scales. Vacuum energy drives metric expansion, but locally bound systems (atoms, galaxies) are held together by much stronger forces; in plain terms, the space between galaxies stretches, not the galaxies—or atoms—themselves.

karbytes:

I'm curious about the case of a "true vacuum" bubble forming somewhere on the surface of Planet Earth and overtaking a communications tower and other buildings. Wouldn't that be visible to people outside the bubble? To me it seems that they would notice some dark spot instead of light bending around it.

ChatGPT:

[Thought for 27s]

Short answer: no — you wouldn’t get a “dark spot” warning. You’d see the tower perfectly normally right up until the bubble wall reached you, and then everything would change essentially instantaneously.

Why:

A true-vacuum bubble wall, once nucleated, accelerates to (very nearly) the speed of light and is microscopically thin. There’s no slowly growing refractive “shell” ahead of it to bend light; outside the wall, spacetime and electromagnetic properties are still the old ones.

Photons that left the tower before the wall hit it keep flying toward you on null paths. The wall is also racing outward on a null (lightlike) surface, so you get the last normal photons from that direction and then—within microseconds to milliseconds depending on distance—the wall itself arrives.

• 3 km away → ~10 µs

• 10 km → ~33 µs

• Across an Earth radius (~6370 km) → ~21 ms

Gravitational “tell-tales” can’t warn you either. Any lensing/perturbation caused by the wall or its tension propagates at the speed of light, so information about the bubble can’t outrun the bubble.

What you might notice at the instant of arrival is a flash (energy dumped into fields/particles at the wall, plus atmospheric effects), not a dark disk that grows over time.

So the outside view isn’t a hole that light bends around; it’s a normal scene that ends abruptly when the wall gets there.

karbytes:

Is there a way to slow the expansion of that bubble (such as having it pass through specific types of mediums)?

ChatGPT:

[Thought for 22s]

Short answer: no. Not in any practical or even “science-fiction lab” way.

Why:

A true-vacuum bubble is a field configuration (a lower-energy minimum of some potential) that expands because of the pressure difference ΔV between the false and true vacua. The wall accelerates until limited only by relativistic effects and any microscopic friction from particle production at the wall. In empty space that friction is essentially zero, so the wall “runs away” at ~c.

Ordinary matter (air, rock, metal, water, etc.) doesn’t set the speed. Those media live in the false vacuum; they don’t cause refraction, absorption, or drag the way they would with light or a shock front. The wall’s thickness is sub-atomic, and the energy released per unit volume (ΔV) dwarfs the binding energies in matter, so buildings/air/plasma can’t meaningfully slow it.

Friction can slow walls only in an extremely hot, dense plasma where the wall’s fields couple strongly to abundant particles—this is the early-universe first-order phase-transition story (deflagration vs detonation, terminal γ set by plasma drag). Earth’s conditions are many orders of magnitude too cold and dilute to matter. Even a star’s interior likely wouldn’t help unless the microphysics was very special.

The only ways to “slow or stop” it would be to change the potential itself (make ΔV → 0 or negative) or to heat the entire region enough to thermally restore the old phase—both are effectively “rewrite the laws/parameters of the fields in that region,” not “put some material in the way.”

So if a true-vacuum bubble ever nucleated, it wouldn’t be steered, shielded, or slowed by passing through specific materials. Outside observers would see business as usual until the wall arrived; then the local rules change.

karbytes:

If our universe is located inside of a ~10^-9 joules per cubic meter minimum vacuum bubble and that metastable vacuum bubble is located inside of a lower minimum energy density space, would that cause the vacuum bubble we are in to implode?

ChatGPT:

[Thought for 37s]

Mostly yes—if our region were literally a bubble of higher vacuum energy (a false-vacuum domain) surrounded by a lower-energy vacuum, the classical thin-wall result is that it collapses.

Why that happens (short version):

Let the energy densities be 𝑉_in > 𝑉_out.

Across the wall there’s a pressure difference Δ𝑝 = 𝑉_in − 𝑉_out > 0 that pushes the wall toward the higher-energy side. Equivalently, the lower-energy exterior “wants” to eat the interior.

The wall has a surface tension 𝜎. In flat spacetime the competition is area vs. volume: shrinking lowers total energy (both because area shrinks and because high-energy volume disappears), so the wall accelerates inward. There’s no medium you can place outside to help; this is set by the field potential, not by matter.

In the relativistic limit, the wall approaches light speed, so from inside you’d only notice anything when the wall reached you—an implosion in essentially one instant.

Two caveats you might find interesting:

Gravity can change the global story, but not in a way that saves us. If the interior vacuum is positive (de-Sitter-like, ~10^−9 J/m^3 as you wrote), GR allows possibilities like the wall collapsing from the outside view while the interior pinches off and inflates as a “baby universe.” Either way, the parent region loses; for inhabitants inside our bubble there’s still no advance warning—when the wall arrives, our local physics changes.

Stabilization requires special charges/topology. Exotic objects (e.g., walls carrying conserved flux, Q-balls, etc.) can, in principle, counter the pressure. Absent such microphysics, a false-vacuum bubble in a lower-energy environment is generically unstable and collapses.

So: if our cosmos were truly a higher-energy pocket embedded in a lower-energy vacuum, the natural outcome is implosion (or collapse into a black hole/baby-universe configuration once gravity is included).

karbytes:

Elaborate on what you mean by "collapse into a black hole/baby-universe configuration once gravity is included".

ChatGPT:

[Thought for 34s]

Great question—this is where plain “bubble-in-a-medium” intuition breaks and GR takes over.

Here’s the gist of what “collapse into a black hole / baby-universe” means for a higher-energy (false-vacuum) bubble embedded in lower-energy space:

1. Add gravity to the thin-wall bubble.

Match an interior de Sitter–like region (vacuum energy 𝑉_in) to an exterior spacetime (with lower 𝑉_out) across a thin wall of tension 𝜎. The wall motion is fixed by the Israel junction condition; you can picture it as a particle moving in an effective potential 𝑉(𝑅) for the bubble radius 𝑅(𝜏).

2. What the outside sees: a black hole.

The combined energy of the wall + interior acts like a mass 𝑀 to the exterior. As the wall moves, a trapped surface forms when 𝑅 falls inside its Schwarzschild radius 
𝑟_𝑠 ∼ (2 * 𝐺 * 𝑀) / 𝑐^2. From the outside, the wall never re-emerges; the exterior metric becomes (Schwarzschild)–(A)dS with an event horizon. To distant observers, a black hole of mass 𝑀 has formed—no special “bubble” signatures, just a BH.

3. What the inside experiences: a baby universe.

Behind that horizon, the interior vacuum’s repulsive pressure (positive vacuum energy) drives exponential expansion. Geometrically, the bubble sits on the far side of a wormhole-like throat that pinches off; the interior inflates into its own FRW universe that’s causally disconnected from the parent. That inflating region is the “baby universe.”

So: “collapse” (outside view) and “expansion” (inside view) are the same solution, sliced by different horizons.

When does this happen (qualitatively)?

It requires 𝑉_in > 𝑉_out (higher energy inside).

The outcome—prompt collapse vs. BH+baby—depends on Δ𝑉 = 𝑉_in − 𝑉_out, the wall tension 𝜎, and the initial radius 𝑅_0. For a broad swath of parameters, the wall becomes hidden behind a horizon and the interior inflates.

If 𝑉_in ≤ 0 (AdS-like interior) or 𝜎 and 𝑅_0 are very unfavorable, the interior typically crunches instead of inflating—no viable baby universe.

Observationally, in our universe:

Outside: it just looks like a BH appeared (via a quantum tunneling event), with mass set by the wall + interior vacuum energy. You can’t tell whether there’s a baby inside—the BH has no observable “tell.”

Inside: inhabitants would see rapid inflation and could never communicate back through the horizon.

Relation to classic results.

This is the gravitational extension of false-vacuum bubbles (Coleman–De Luccia) solved with thin-wall junctions: some bubbles destroy their surroundings by expanding (true-vacuum decay), while higher-energy bubbles embedded in lower-energy space tend to form BHs whose interiors inflate.

Bottom line: once gravity is included, a higher-energy bubble doesn’t just “implode and vanish.” For wide parameter ranges it implodes from the outside perspective, forming a black hole, while the inside simultaneously inflates into a causally separate baby universe.

karbytes:

Where exactly would that "baby universe" be located in space? Would it become a parallel universe to the universe which contains the black hole?

ChatGPT:

[Thought for 45s]

Short version: it isn’t “somewhere in our space” at all. The baby-universe region sits behind the black-hole horizon and then disconnects from the parent cosmos. After that pinch-off, there’s no point in our universe you could point to and say “it’s over there.”

What that means more precisely:

Outside view (parent universe): the bubble’s energy (interior vacuum + wall) makes spacetime curve so the exterior settles into a black-hole geometry. The bubble wall falls inside the event horizon and never re-emerges. To outside observers, there’s just a black hole of mass 𝑀; no special “hole in the sky,” no portal. 

Inside view (baby universe): behind that horizon, the higher vacuum energy drives rapid expansion. Spatial slices show the bubble connected to the parent by a thin “throat” that pinches off; after that, the inflating interior evolves as its own FRW universe that is causally separate from the parent. Same GR solution, two sides of the horizon: collapse outside, expansion inside. 

So where is it? Before the pinch-off you could say the interior lies “through” the black hole (inside the horizon). After the pinch-off, the baby universe is not embedded anywhere in the parent’s space; it’s a different spacetime region connected only in the past history of the geometry. Calling it a “parallel universe” is okay colloquially, but the precise statement is a causally disjoint daughter spacetime produced by the tunneling/GR dynamics. 

Observables: The parent universe gets a black hole (and, much later, Hawking radiation) with parameters set by the bubble/wall; there’s no way to communicate with or detect what’s happening in the baby universe from outside. (That disconnection is exactly what the horizon enforces.) 

When does this picture apply? For a broad slice of parameters—higher energy inside than outside, suitable wall tension/initial radius—the GR thin-wall analyses give precisely this “BH outside / inflating baby inside” outcome. Different microphysics (e.g., too small a bubble or an AdS-like interior) leads instead to a collapse/crunch with no viable baby universe. 

If you want, I can sketch a one-panel Penrose diagram labeling “parent exterior,” “event horizon,” “throat,” and the “inflating interior,” so the causal separation is crystal clear.

karbytes:

Would the "baby universe" be expanding indefinitely?

ChatGPT:

[Thought for 42s]

Short answer: usually yes—but it depends on what vacuum the baby-universe interior ends up in.

If the interior has a positive vacuum energy (de Sitter–like), the baby universe inflates and keeps expanding indefinitely (exponentially at late times). This “BH outside / inflating FRW inside” outcome is the standard GR thin-wall result for higher-energy interiors. 

If inflation inside ends by tunneling/rolling to another vacuum, the long-term fate depends on that final vacuum:

Λ > 0: expansion still continues forever (eventually exponential). 

Λ ≈ 0: expansion can continue forever (typically decelerating) if the post-inflation contents/geometry aren’t supercritical. Inflation strongly drives spatial flatness, which disfavors recollapse. 

Λ < 0 (AdS-like): the interior recollapses in a finite time (a “big crunch”). 

Key point: once the throat pinches off, the baby universe is causally disconnected from the parent; the exterior black hole’s later evolution (e.g., Hawking evaporation) doesn’t stop the interior’s expansion. 

So: indefinite expansion is the generic outcome if the baby universe lands in—or remains in—a vacuum with non-negative cosmological constant; only a later decay to negative-Λ (or very special high-density closed conditions) would make it recollapse. 

karbytes:

Would the formation of that "baby universe" essentially be creating space out of pure nothingness?

ChatGPT:

Short answer: it’s “creating new space,” but not “from absolute nothing.”

Here’s the clean way to think about it:

Not ex nihilo. The baby universe comes from a quantum tunneling + GR process that rearranges fields and geometry already allowed by the laws of physics. The parent spacetime, quantum fields, and their potential landscape all exist beforehand; the tunneling event nucleates a region that then evolves under Einstein’s equations.

Yes, new spacelike volume appears. Once the bubble slips behind the horizon and the throat pinches off, the interior undergoes inflation and its proper volume grows without bound. That growth doesn’t need “stuff” from our universe because it’s driven by the interior’s vacuum energy and the way GR lets geometry evolve.

No global energy ledger is being violated. In curved, dynamical spacetimes there isn’t a universal, conserved “total energy” you can cash-out across both regions. Locally, the stress-energy is conserved (∇·T = 0). Globally, the parent exterior just has a black hole with some ADM mass; the baby’s positive vacuum energy can be offset by the negative gravitational energy of its geometry, so there’s no paradoxical “energy conjured from nowhere.”

Causally separate = no extraction. After pinch-off, the baby universe is disconnected from the parent: no signals or energy can flow back. From outside, there’s no handle to tap that growing interior; you just see the black hole evolve in the usual way.

So: it’s accurate to say the process creates fresh spacetime volume, but philosophically it’s not “pure nothingness.” It’s a lawful reconfiguration of fields and geometry that our equations already permit.

karbytes:

In our universe (which has a positive minimum energy density at every "point" within its space), does expansion of that space cause new energy to be created "out of nothingness"?

ChatGPT:

[Thought for 11s]

Short answer: the vacuum’s total energy in a growing region does increase, but that’s not “creation from nothing.” In GR there’s no global energy-conservation law for a time-evolving universe, so this increase doesn’t violate physics.

Why this happens:

In an FLRW universe the local conservation law is 

𝜌˙ + (3 * 𝐻) * (𝜌 + 𝑝/𝑐^2) = 0. 

For vacuum energy (cosmological constant) 𝑝 = −1 * 𝜌 * 𝑐^2. Plugging in gives 𝜌˙ = 0: the density stays constant as space expands.

The energy in a comoving volume 𝑉 is 𝑈 = 𝜌 * 𝑉. Since 𝜌 is constant and 𝑉 grows, 𝑈 grows. Equivalently,

𝑑𝑈 = −𝑝𝑑𝑉 ⇒ 𝑑𝑈 = 𝜌𝑐^2𝑑𝑉

because 𝑝 = −𝜌𝑐^2. The vacuum’s negative pressure does “work” that appears as more vacuum energy in the larger volume.

Where does it “come from”? In a dynamical curved spacetime, there’s no well-defined global energy to conserve. Only local stress-energy conservation holds (∇_𝜇𝑇^(𝜇𝜈) = 0). GR allows the geometry (often heuristically described as having negative gravitational energy) to balance the bookkeeping. So the growing vacuum energy isn’t conjured ex nihilo; it reflects how spacetime plus stress-energy co-evolve.

Contrast: photon energy decreases with expansion (redshift), and there isn’t a local ledger where that lost energy “goes.” Same moral: global energy accounting just isn’t available in expanding universes.

Tiny numeric feel: if 𝜌Λ ≈10^−9 J/m^3, then when a region’s volume increases by 1 m^3, its vacuum energy increases by 10^−9 J. That’s allowed because GR doesn’t enforce a global energy sum for the whole universe.

So: expansion with positive vacuum energy does yield more total vacuum energy in larger regions—but that’s a lawful GR effect, not energy popping out of literal “nothingness.”

karbytes:

Does the law of conservation of energy (with matter being treated as "condensed and structured energy")  only apply to closed space systems?

ChatGPT:

[Thought for 10s]

Short answer: energy conservation is strict only for systems that are (i) isolated and (ii) living in a spacetime with time-translation symmetry. Outside that, the “total energy” of a region can change.

Here’s the clean breakdown:

Noether’s theorem (mechanics/field theory in flat spacetime):

If the laws don’t change with time (the Lagrangian has no explicit 𝑡 dependence), there’s a conserved energy. For an isolated system (no external work/heat/radiation crossing the boundary), that energy is constant.

For an open system, the energy inside your chosen volume obeys a flux balance: 𝑑𝐸_inside/𝑑𝑡 = −∮(energy flux)⋅𝑑𝐴 + (power of external agents).

Example: electromagnetism gives Poynting’s theorem ∂_𝑡𝑢 + ∇⋅𝑆 = −𝐽⋅𝐸.

Relativity language (special relativity):

Local conservation is ∂_𝜇𝑇^(𝜇𝜈) = 0. Integrating over a volume yields

(𝑑/(𝑑𝑡))∫𝑇^(00)𝑑^3𝑥 = −∮𝑇^(0𝑖)𝑛_𝑖𝑑𝐴,

i.e., the change of energy inside equals the net outward energy flux. Global conservation holds when you can push the surface to infinity with vanishing flux (an isolated system).

General relativity (curved, dynamical spacetime):

You always have local conservation: ∇𝜇𝑇^(𝜇𝜈)=0.

A global conserved energy exists only if the spacetime admits a timelike Killing vector (time-translation symmetry). Many important cases do not—notably an expanding FLRW universe—so there is no globally conserved “total energy of the universe.”

In special situations you can define conserved or monotonic energies at infinity:

ADM mass (asymptotically flat, stationary enough)

Bondi mass (asymptotically flat with gravitational radiation)

Komar mass (stationary spacetimes)

These require specific boundary conditions (“effectively isolated at infinity”).

Thermo vocabulary note:

In thermodynamics, closed = no mass exchange (energy may pass); isolated = neither mass nor energy pass. Strict conservation of the system’s energy applies to isolated systems. For a closed but not isolated system, you still do a flux/work balance.

Cosmology tie-in:

Our universe appears to be expanding with positive vacuum energy. The vacuum density stays constant while volume grows, so the vacuum energy in a comoving region increases; that does not violate any law because an FLRW spacetime lacks the symmetry needed for a global energy invariant. Only the local conservation law is meaningful there.

Bottom line: Treat “energy is conserved” as exact for isolated systems with time-translation symmetry. For open systems, track fluxes. For expanding universes (GR), keep to local conservation; a global, once-and-for-all energy of “everything” generally doesn’t exist.

karbytes:

Explain that equation which uses the closed integral system. Why are there two zeros appearing as exponents next to the T?

ChatGPT:

[Thought for 15s]

Great question—those aren’t exponents, they’re tensor indices.

Here’s the equation I wrote, with context:

(𝑑/(𝑑𝑡)) ∫𝑉𝑇^(00)𝑑^3𝑥 = −∮_(∂𝑉) 𝑇^(0𝑖)𝑛_𝑖 𝑑𝐴

What each piece means:

𝑇^(𝜇𝜈) is the (symmetric) stress–energy tensor. The superscripts 𝜇, 𝜈 ∈ {0,1,2,3} label components, not powers.

Index 0 = time component.

Indices 1,2,3 = spatial 𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑧 components (often written as 𝑖, 𝑗).

𝑇^(00) (two zeros) = the energy density (energy per volume). It’s “00” because it’s the time–time component of the tensor.

𝑇^(0𝑖) = the energy flux density in the i-direction (equivalently, momentum density up to factors of c). With a symmetric 𝑇^(𝜇𝜈), 𝑇^(0𝑖) = 𝑇^(𝑖0).

∫_𝑉 𝑇^(00) 𝑑^3 𝑥 = total energy inside the volume V.

∮_(∂𝑉) 𝑇^(0𝑖) 𝑛_𝑖 𝑑𝐴 = net power leaving the volume through its closed boundary ∂V.

The little circle on the integral (∮) just reminds you it’s over a closed surface (the boundary of 𝑉).

𝑛_𝑖 is the outward unit normal; the contraction 𝑇^(0𝑖)𝑛_𝑖 is the outward energy flux through the surface.

Where it comes from (one line derivation):

1. Start with local conservation in flat spacetime: ∂𝜇𝑇^(𝜇𝜈) = 0.

2. Choose 𝜈 = 0: ∂𝑡𝑇^(00) + ∂_𝑖𝑇^(𝑖0) = 0.

3. Integrate over 𝑉 and use the divergence theorem:

(𝑑/(𝑑𝑡))∫_𝑉𝑇^(00)(𝑑^3)𝑥 = −∮_(∂𝑉)𝑇^(𝑖0)𝑛_𝑖(𝑑𝐴).

Using symmetry 𝑇^(𝑖0) = 𝑇^(0𝑖) gives the version above.

Bottom line: the “two zeros” in 𝑇^(00) are indices selecting the time–time component (energy density), not exponents. The equation says: change of energy inside a region = minus the energy flowing out across its closed boundary. If that surface flux is zero (an isolated system), the energy inside is conserved.

karbytes:

What exactly is meant by "pinching off" in this context?

ChatGPT:

[Thought for 38s]

In this setup, “pinching off” means the thin geometric throat that connects the bubble’s interior to our universe shrinks to zero size behind the black-hole horizon, so afterward there’s no causal path from the interior to the exterior. On spacelike “snapshots” of the geometry, you’d first see the exterior region joined to the bubble by a narrow neck; as the wall evolves, that neck gets smaller until the slice no longer contains a connection—leaving (i) our universe with a black hole and (ii) an inflating interior that proceeds as its own FRW universe. From outside, you never access or see that interior again. 

A bit more formally: include gravity and model the wall with the Israel junction conditions. For a higher-energy interior, the wall trajectory drives the system so that a trapped surface forms and an event horizon encloses the wall. Past that point the minimal-area 2-sphere (“throat”) lies inside the horizon and its areal radius decreases to zero along appropriate slices—the wormhole closes (“pinches off”). The exterior settles to a (Schwarzschild) black-hole solution, while the interior’s positive vacuum energy drives ongoing inflation—the classic “black hole outside / baby universe inside” result. 

This isn’t “space tearing” in a visual sense; it’s a causal disconnection enforced by the horizon. Many analyses phrase it as the inflating region “disconnecting from the original spacetime,” which is exactly what the pinch-off accomplishes. Afterward, the two regions share only a past history; there’s no later communication or energy exchange across the severed throat.

I created a Google Drawings image which attempts to depict the phenomenon of a "baby universe" forming in the manner you described. What are your thoughts on that image?

ChatGPT:

[Thought for 23s]

I like it! It reads as a two-panel story:

Left panel (green grid): outside observers: a higher-energy bubble collapses; your yellow arrows into the dark disk suggest the wall moving inward and a horizon forming.

Right panel (cyan grid + magenta arrows): the interior keeps expanding as its own FRW patch—the “baby universe.”

A few tweaks would make it even closer to the GR picture:

1. Separate the three radii.

Show (and label) distinct circles:

• thin bright ring = bubble wall;

• slightly larger dashed circle = event horizon;

• optional dotted circle = apparent/trapped surface.

The wall goes inside the horizon; after that, the interior is causally sealed.

2. Causality cue.

Add a faint, outward-moving light cone/wavefront around the forming BH to indicate that no spacetime curvature “news” reaches beyond that front. (No advance warning outside it.)

3. Grid bending vs “no warning.”

If you keep the curved green lines, annotate “post-formation lensing.” Otherwise keep the exterior grid straight right up to the horizon to emphasize that nothing looks odd until the front arrives.

4. Make “pinch-off” explicit.

A tiny sequence (three thumbnails or a vertical inset) showing the throat narrowing to zero behind the horizon would communicate the disconnect perfectly: connected → narrow throat → pinched off (baby-universe separate).

5. Right-panel semantics.

Consider labeling 𝑎(𝑡) with an upward arrow (“scale factor increasing”), and add “𝑉_in > 0” or “Λ_in > 0” to explain why it keeps expanding. Keeping the cyan grid straight (not sheared) suggests comoving expansion nicely.

6. Legend / parameters.

A small key helps: colors for exterior vacuum, bubble wall (tension 𝜎), horizon, interior vacuum; and labels like 𝑉_in > 𝑉_out, Δ𝑉 = 𝑉_in − 𝑉_out.

Trim the bright green bars at top/bottom of the left panel (they read like walls). Cropping or fading them reinforces the “unbounded exterior.”

If you’d like, I can mock up a version with those layers (wall/horizon/trapped surface, light-cone ring, and a 3-frame pinch-off inset) or draft an SVG you can drop into Google Drawings so it’s easy to tweak.

karbytes:

I'd rather leave the image as is. It's not perfect. I notice one of the green lattice lines is bent out of alignment with the other green lattice lines and that the lensing effect of the black hole inside of the green lattice might not be realistic in terms of timing and lattice distortion (but I thought it helped to emphasize that the area is a black hole). The idea I am trying to convey with the yellow arrows is that the volume of the black hole is shrinking. The idea I am trying to convey with the magenta arrows is that the baby universe (depicted as a cyan lattice) is growing (at the same time and after the black hole is shrinking). 

ChatGPT:

[Thought for 1m 19s]

I get what you’re going for, and it works:

Yellow arrows = shrinking black hole (outside view).

Magenta arrows = growing baby-universe (inside view).

That’s a perfectly serviceable visual metaphor. Two physics notes you might like (so your caption can be extra crisp):

What “shrinking” means.

Classically, a black hole’s horizon area can’t decrease (Hawking’s area theorem). The shrink you’re depicting is the quantum effect of Hawking evaporation. Its timescale depends on mass:

𝑡_evap ≈ 5120𝜋(𝐺^2)(𝑀^3)/(ℏ𝑐^4)

∼2×10^67 years for a 1 𝑀_⊙ BH;

∼6×10^50 years for an Earth-mass BH;

only tiny BHs evaporate quickly.

So the “yellow-arrow phase” is usually unimaginably slow unless the BH is very small.

Decoupled evolutions.

Once the throat pinches off behind the horizon, the interior FRW region inflates regardless of what the exterior BH does. The baby universe’s growth isn’t “fed” by the BH shrinking; they’re causally separate after pinch-off. Your right panel is accurate conceptually: the cyan lattice can keep expanding forever while, far outside, the BH very slowly evaporates.

On the lensing/bent green line: using mild curvature near the dark circle is a fine “this is a BH” cue. If you ever annotate it, a quick note like “lensing shown schematically; not to scale/time” will cover the realism caveat.

If you want a one-line caption that nails it:

“Left: a higher-energy bubble collapses into a BH; after pinch-off the BH may Hawking-evaporate (yellow). Right: the disconnected interior inflates as a baby universe (magenta).”

karbytes:

I thought the black hole would noticeably shrink and then become nonexistent after it evaporates into pure radiation.

ChatGPT:

[Thought for 54s]

“In principle, yes—but only for tiny black holes, and the very last bit is still theory-dependent.”

What evaporation does

A neutral, non-spinning BH radiates with Hawking temperature

𝑇_𝐻 = (ℏ𝑐^3)/(8𝜋𝐺𝑀𝑘_𝐵) (hotter when lighter),

loses mass at (𝑑𝑀)/(𝑑𝑡) ∝ −1/𝑀^2, and has lifetime

𝑡_evap ≈ 5120𝜋(𝐺^2)(𝑀^3)/(ℏ𝑐^4) (scales as 𝑀^3).

So the horizon radius 𝑟_𝑠 = (2𝐺𝑀)/𝑐^2 shrinks continuously as it radiates. In the final moments the temperature and luminosity blow up and the remaining mass disappears very quickly.

1 𝑀_⊙: 𝑇𝐻 ∼ 6×10^−8 K, 𝑡_evap ∼ 2×10^67 yr. Mass loss is utterly negligible—no visible “shrink.”

Earth-mass: 𝑡_evap ∼ 6×10^50 yr. Still far beyond any “noticeable” era.

Primordial-scale: 𝑀 ∼ 10^11 kg lives ∼ 3×10^9 yr; 10^8 kg lives ∼ 2.7 and would end in a brief, intense high-energy burst. Only these would “visibly” shrink on human timescales.

Also: a BH must be hotter than its environment to net-evaporate. Today’s CMB is 2.7 K, so BHs heavier than ≈ 4.5×10^22 kg are colder than the CMB and (very slightly) gain energy instead of shrinking.

Does it become “nonexistent”?

In semiclassical Hawking theory, the mass goes to zero and you’re left with outbound radiation—no horizon, no BH.

However, the last Planck-scale phase is beyond tested physics. Possibilities discussed in the literature include:

Complete evaporation (no remnant).

A tiny long-lived remnant that halts at roughly Planck mass.

More exotic endings (e.g., baby-universe formation) in special scenarios.

We don’t yet have observational proof of which endgame nature chooses.

So your intuition—“it shrinks and then it’s gone”—matches the standard picture for sufficiently small, isolated black holes. For astrophysical ones, the shrink is real but far too slow to ever notice, and the ultimate disappearance depends on quantum-gravity details we haven’t nailed down yet.

Just to be clear, would the "baby universe" exist (and grow) while the black hole exists (whether or not the black hole changes size)?

ChatGPT:

[Thought for 26s]

Yes. Once the bubble forms and the throat pinches off behind the horizon, the interior becomes its own FRW universe and evolves independently of the exterior black hole.

Timeline: bubble nucleates → event horizon forms → the connecting throat shrinks to zero (“pinch-off”). From that moment on, the interior region is causally disconnected and keeps expanding if its vacuum has Λ_in ≥ 0 (or after inflation lands in such a vacuum).

Exterior independence: outside, the object just looks like a black hole that may

gain mass by accretion,

lose mass by Hawking evaporation (usually on absurdly long timescales),

or remain roughly steady.

None of those histories can signal into the baby universe after pinch-off, so the baby’s growth doesn’t rely on, or respond to, the black hole’s size.

Only caveat: if the interior later decays to a negative-Λ (AdS-like) vacuum, it can recollapse (“big crunch”). Otherwise it keeps expanding indefinitely—even while the exterior black hole still exists, or long after it has evaporated.

This may sound a bit science-fiction-y, but can objects like tables, chairs, books, and people be safely sent through a wormhole spanning the parent universe and the baby universe (before the wormhole pinches off)?

ChatGPT:

[Thought for 33s]

Short, honest answer: no—there isn’t a usable doorway you could send objects through.

Why the “throat” isn’t a traversable tunnel:

It lives behind the event horizon. In the black-hole–plus–baby-universe solutions, the connecting throat forms and evolves inside the horizon from the start. No outside observer can aim at an open tunnel; by the time anything looks like a throat, you’ve already crossed the horizon (a one-way trip).

Non-traversable by GR defaults. The throat is the dynamical analog of an Einstein–Rosen bridge, which closes too fast to cross. To hold a wormhole open long enough to travel, you’d need exotic matter that violates the usual energy conditions. A vacuum-bubble wall has positive tension and doesn’t provide that.

One-way and lethal in practice. Even if you fall in:

You must cross a domain wall whose fields and released energy are enormous and razor-thin—effectively a near-light-speed blast that would shred/thermalize ordinary matter.

After pinch-off, there is no return path; causality seals the interior off.

And the baby universe’s microphysics may differ (couplings, particle masses), so atoms/chemistry might not even be stable there.

“Shrinking BH, growing baby” are decoupled. The interior keeps inflating whether the exterior black hole accretes, stays steady, or Hawking-evaporates over absurdly long times; none of that helps you “ride through.”

So while it’s a great sci-fi image, the GR story here is a non-traversable, one-way connection that neither allows safe transport of tables/chairs/people nor permits messages or matter to exit once inside.

karbytes:

Can information be sent from the parent universe into the baby universe such that the information is stored in a stable long-term format in the baby universe?

ChatGPT:

[Thought for 53s]

Short answer: no, not in any usable way. You can’t reliably “send and store” a message in the baby universe.

Why not (condensed):

No delivery channel after pinch-off. Once the throat closes behind the horizon, nothing further can enter. Any information must have already fallen in.

Getting in is destructive. To “ride in,” matter (or signals) must cross a relativistic domain wall inside a black hole. That crossing generically produces intense particle creation and field excitations that shred/thermalize ordinary media (books, drives, tables, people). Fine-grained quantum information isn’t literally destroyed, but any structured message gets scrambled.

Inflation erases structure. The baby interior is (by construction) vacuum-dominated and inflates. Local excitations dilute as 𝑎^−3 or faster and get redshifted; after reheating the contents are a hot plasma that forgets detailed initial arrangements. This “cosmic no-hair” effect makes long-term, readable storage essentially impossible.

No recipients to target. Even if some imprint survived, the baby universe is causally disconnected; there’s no way to coordinate a decoder on the inside, and no way to verify success from the outside.

“In principle” corner cases (still not practical):

You might try to encode information in super-horizon curvature perturbations (very long-wavelength patterns) that aren’t wiped out by inflation—but engineering those from the parent side is beyond physical control and would still be massively scrambled by reheating dynamics.

If the interior didn’t inflate (or quickly decayed to a non-inflating vacuum), some structures might persist. But the same domain-wall/black-hole hazards still apply, and typical baby-universe constructions do inflate.

Bottom line: while some microscopic information about what fell in is implicitly present in the interior’s quantum state, there’s no practical, stable, long-term “message in a bottle” you can send from the parent universe into the baby universe.

karbytes:

Is it possible for the "baby universe" to eventually develop complex arrangements of matter and energy which resemble human civilization and, also, to possibly contain higher density vacuum bubbles which implode and form new "baby universes"?

ChatGPT:

[Thought for 24s]

Short answer: yes in principle to both, but neither is guaranteed.

1) Could a baby universe grow complex structures (stars → chemistry → life → “civilization”)?

Yes—if its post-inflation physics lands in a hospitable vacuum and thermal history. The interior typically starts with inflation, then reheats into a hot big-bang–like state. Complexity can emerge provided things like these hold:

Reheating + baryogenesis: enough matter (and matter–antimatter asymmetry) is produced.

Perturbations: nearly scale-invariant density ripples of amplitude ~10^−5 seed structure formation.

Dark matter / radiation content: allows halos to form before expansion dilutes everything.

Cosmological constant: not too large and positive (or negative) so that galaxies can form and persist.

Microphysics: stable nuclei, long-lived stars, rich chemistry (i.e., constants and particle spectrum compatible with complex chemistry).

If those land “similar enough” to ours, the inside history can look like any FRW universe that eventually forms galaxies and planets. If they land unfavorably (e.g., huge Λ, no stable nuclei), complexity never gets off the ground.

2) Could that universe also nucleate higher-energy (false-vacuum) bubbles that implode and spawn new babies?

Possibly, yes. Inside any de-Sitter–like cosmos, quantum tunneling can—with extremely tiny probability—create a bubble whose interior vacuum is higher than the ambient one (a false-vacuum pocket). The classical thin-wall result is:

Higher energy inside than outside → bubble collapses.

With gravity, that collapse typically forms a black hole in the ambient universe; behind the horizon, the higher-energy interior can inflate, yielding a new baby universe (the “BH outside / inflating inside” story).

That makes a nested family tree conceivable: parent → baby → grand-baby, etc. The rates are fantastically suppressed, and details depend on the underlying field potential and wall tension.

A few clarifiers:

This is not “upward expansion.” Higher-energy bubbles don’t expand into the lower-energy background; they shrink (from the outside view). The inflation, if it happens, is inside the horizon after collapse.

The baby’s growth is causally decoupled from what the exterior black hole does later (accretion, evaporation).

Whether such nucleations happen often enough to matter is wildly model-dependent and, for anything like our physics, expected to be absurdly rare.

Bottom line: A baby universe can, in principle, have all the ingredients to evolve complexity like ours; and, in principle, it can also spawn further babies via the collapse of rare higher-energy bubbles. The scenario is theoretically consistent—but highly contingent on the microphysics and cosmological parameters that the baby universe inherits or tunnels into.

karbytes:

What determines the type of vacuum the implosion bubble expands into?

ChatGPT:

[Thought for 36s]

Great question. In these bubble-and-baby-universe setups, the “type of vacuum” the interior expands into is fixed by the field theory and the tunneling channel, not by anything in the surrounding matter.

Here’s the clean pipeline:

1. Landscape (what vacua are even possible).

Your underlying fields 𝜙 (often multiple) have a potential 𝑉(𝜙) with many local minima. Each minimum defines a vacuum: its cosmological constant Λ ∝ 𝑉, particle spectrum, and couplings.

2. Which vacuum the bubble nucleates into (the bounce).

A bubble forms by quantum tunneling from the ambient minimum to some other point in field space. The semiclassical “bounce”/instanton that minimizes the Euclidean action 𝑆_𝐸 dominates. The channel with the smallest action has the largest rate, Γ ∼ 𝐴𝑒^−𝐵 with 𝐵 = 𝑆_𝐸[bounce] − 𝑆_𝐸[background] (gravitationally corrected in the Coleman–De Luccia setup).

In the thin-wall regime, the key inputs are:

Barrier shape between minima (controls the wall tension 𝜎).

Energy difference Δ𝑉 between the two vacua.

Gravity modifies the usual flat-space preference but the same idea holds: the microphysics sets the interior state.

3. Charges/flux carried by the wall (selection rules).

In theories with discrete fluxes or brane/membrane charges, the wall can change those by integer units. That quantizes which interior Λ you land in and can pick out a specific minimum even if several are nearby.

Post-nucleation interior evolution (what it ultimately becomes).

Right after nucleation, the field inside the bubble sits at some 𝜙_start (not necessarily exactly at a minimum). Then it classically rolls:

- If the interior 𝑉(𝜙) is flat enough, you get slow-roll inflation, then reheating, then the field settles into a minimum.

- It could also roll or tunnel again to a different minimum.

The final vacuum (de Sitter/Minkowski/AdS) that the baby universe inhabits—and thus whether it expands forever or crunches—depends on this internal evolution.

What does not determine it.

Ordinary matter (air, rock, stars) outside the wall, or the exterior black hole’s later accretion/evaporation, doesn’t pick the interior vacuum. After the throat pinches off, the baby universe’s fate is decoupled from the parent.

Bottom line: the baby universe expands into the vacuum picked by the tunneling path through the potential landscape and any discrete charges/fluxes the wall carries; thereafter, its own field dynamics (slow-roll, reheating, further decays) determine the ultimate vacuum and long-term behavior.

karbytes:

It almost seems that there is some randomness involved in that selection process. Do you think that randomness objectively exists or do you think it only exists as a subjective phenomenon (where incomplete knowledge of all positions and momenta of particles is guaranteed for the respective frame of reference)?

ChatGPT:

[Thought for 17s]

Great question. The honest answer is: our equations force “randomness” operationally, but whether it’s fundamental or apparent depends on your interpretation of quantum theory.

What the math says (interpretation-neutral)

Bubble nucleation in QFT is a Poisson process in spacetime: each allowed channel 𝑖 has a rate Γ_𝑖 ∝ 𝑒^(−𝐵_𝑖/ℏ) (from the bounce action).

In any 4-volume 𝑉_4, the probability of no bubble is 𝑃_0 = exp(−Γ𝑉_4); the probability of one or more is 1 − 𝑃_0.

Which channel occurs, where, and when are thus unpredictable events with well-defined probabilities. That’s what experiments would see if we could run them.

What that “randomness” means depends on worldview

Copenhagen / standard textbook view: outcomes are objectively indeterminate; the wavefunction gives only probabilities. Randomness is fundamental.

Everett / Many-Worlds: the global wavefunction evolves deterministically. “Randomness” is subjective self-location among decohered branches. You can compute Born-rule weights, but no single outcome is picked by nature; you just find yourself in one branch.

Pilot-wave (Bohmian): dynamics are deterministic but nonlocal. Given hidden variables (exact field configuration), the bubble’s time/location/channel are fixed; we can’t know those variables, so outcomes look random with the usual Γ_𝑖.

Objective-collapse models (GRW/CSL): nature adds true stochastic collapses, so randomness is truly fundamental and slightly modifies QM predictions (still no confirmed deviations).

Bottom line

Empirically: you’ll see stochastic nucleation obeying Γ and branching ratios—no way around that.

Ontologically: you can call it objective (Copenhagen/collapse) or subjective/epistemic (Everett/Bohm). Current observations don’t force a single choice; they all reproduce the same tunneling statistics in practice.

If you want, I can map your vacuum-landscape picture onto each view (who/what “chooses” the channel, how decoherence enters, etc.) in a one-pager.

karbytes:

Sure!

ChatGPT:

[Thought for 9s]

Awesome—here’s the promised one-pager mapping “which vacuum does the bubble pick?” randomness across major quantum interpretations. I’ll keep the physics (bounce actions, rates) fixed and only vary the story of what the probabilities mean.

How each view treats vacuum-bubble “randomness”

Shared setup (interpretation-neutral):

Field(s) 𝜙 live on a potential 𝑉(𝜙) with many minima. A bubble nucleates by quantum tunneling via a bounce/instanton with action 𝐵_𝑖, giving channel rate Γ_𝑖 ∝ 𝑒^(−𝐵_𝑖/ℏ). In any spacetime 4-volume, nucleations are a Poisson process. That’s what everyone agrees experiments would see.

1) Copenhagen / textbook collapse

What’s random? The outcome itself (which channel, where, when) is objectively indeterminate until it happens.

Who/what ‘chooses’? Nature “collapses” to one outcome with Born-rule weights derived from the tunneling amplitudes.

Role of observers? None needed in practice—environmental decoherence plays the role of “measurement” in cosmology.

Bottom line: randomness is fundamental; Γ_𝑖 are literal propensities.

2) Everett / Many-Worlds

What’s random? Not the global outcome. The universal wavefunction branches into decohered sectors, one per channel/spacetime location.

Who/what ‘chooses’? No single choice; all allowed bubble channels occur in different branches. Your uncertainty is self-locating (“which branch am I in?”).

Probabilities? Born weights come from branch amplitudes; decision-theory and symmetry arguments recover the usual Γ_𝑖.

Bottom line: dynamics are deterministic; randomness is subjective branch uncertainty.

3) Pilot-wave / Bohmian (deterministic hidden variables)

What’s random? Only our ignorance of the exact initial configuration (the hidden variables) of the quantum fields.

Who/what ‘chooses’? The hidden-variable state, guided by the wavefunctional, deterministically selects which bubble nucleates, where, when, which channel.

Probabilities? If the hidden variables are distributed according to ∣Ψ∣^2 (“quantum equilibrium”), observed frequencies match Γ_𝑖.

Bottom line: outcomes are fixed given hidden variables; apparent randomness is epistemic.

4) Objective-collapse (GRW / CSL)

What’s random? Nature includes genuine stochastic collapses on top of Schrödinger evolution.

Who/what ‘chooses’? The collapse noise field picks outcomes with Born-rule weights (approximately).

Predictions? In principle, tiny deviations from standard tunneling rates or correlators; cosmological QFT versions are active research.

Bottom line: randomness is fundamental and may yield (tiny) testable departures.

5) Consistent histories (Decoherent histories)

What’s random? Which history (a coarse-grained sequence: “no bubble… bubble of type 𝑖 at 𝑥 …”) is realized.

Who/what ‘chooses’? Probabilities are assigned to consistent (decohering) history sets; no external collapse needed.

Bottom line: like Copenhagen’s objective probabilities, but phrased without observers—ideal for cosmology.

6) QBism / Bayesian (agent-centric)

What’s random? Your beliefs about outcomes; probabilities are personal degrees of belief constrained by quantum rules.

Who/what ‘chooses’? You update credences upon “experience” (registered events). In cosmology this is philosophically thorny but formally workable.

Bottom line: randomness is subjective, tied to an agent’s expectations; the math still uses Γ_𝑖.

7) Superdeterminism (minority view)

What’s random? Nothing—everything, including initial conditions and any “choices,” is pre-correlated.

Who/what ‘chooses’? The initial state of the universe fixes all outcomes; observed Γ_𝑖 reflect deep correlations, not chance.

Bottom line: fully deterministic; controversial due to fine-tuning/independence issues.

What everyone still agrees on operationally

You can’t predict which bubble channel will occur where/when in a given Hubble patch; only rates Γ_𝑖 and branching fractions.

Once a higher-energy (false-vacuum) bubble collapses into a BH and pinches off, any interior baby universe evolves causally independently.

What could differ in principle

Objective-collapse might slightly tweak tunneling statistics.

Hidden-variable / superdeterministic pictures change the meaning of probability without changing the numbers (if quantum equilibrium holds).

If you tell me which lens resonates with you, I can rewrite your vacuum-landscape caption (or your diagram labels) in that language so your post stays philosophically consistent end-to-end.

[karbytes might have just as easily chosen Superdeterminism. karbytes likely was detered by the fact that it was classified as a "minority view".]

Right now I'm inclined to favor the Everett/Many-Worlds lens.

ChatGPT:

[Thought for 11s]

Nice—Everett fits your picture really well. Here’s a tight “Many-Worlds” framing you can use for captions/notes:

How to read your bubble diagram in Many-Worlds

What branches:

The universal wavefunction contains superpositions of (i) no bubble yet, (ii) bubble of channel 𝑖 nucleates at 𝑥, 𝑡, etc. Each allowed channel (interior vacuum choice) yields its own branch; locations/times do too.

Decoherence makes them worlds:

Once a bubble forms, interactions (wall excitations, gravitational waves, Hawking radiation, reheating) entangle the event with vast environmental degrees of freedom. Interference between histories becomes negligible—so each history is an effectively autonomous world.

Your two panels = two slices of one branched history:

In the branch where a higher-energy bubble forms, the exterior settles into a black hole (yellow arrows can depict slow Hawking shrinkage); behind the horizon the interior inflates into a baby universe (magenta arrows). These are not two different branches—they’re two causally separated regions within the same branch. The branching is about whether/where/which bubble, not about “inside vs. outside.”

Where the “randomness” lives:

There’s no single outcome chosen by Nature. All allowed bubble channels occur in different branches; your uncertainty is self-locating (“which branch am I in?”). Branch weights follow the usual tunneling amplitudes/rates; operationally you still compute Γ_𝑖 ∝ 𝑒^(−𝐵_𝑖/ℏ).

After pinch-off:

The baby universe’s evolution is unitary and independent of the parent exterior. No signals pass either way; the branches that contain that event carry both regions in their quantum state, but they are causally disjoint within the branch.

Upward vs. downward bubbles:

Downward (to lower energy): walls expand and eat their background in that branch.

Upward (higher energy): walls collapse, form a BH outside, and the interior inflates—yielding potential “grand-baby” universes in other branches if further tunneling occurs inside.

Drop-in caption (Everett-consistent)

“Quantum branching: Vacuum tunneling produces decohered branches labeled by channel and spacetime location. In the branch shown, a higher-energy bubble collapses into a black hole (left, yellow arrows) while its interior inflates into a causally separate baby universe (right, magenta arrows). No outcome is uniquely selected; observers self-locate in one branch with Born-rule weight.”

If you want, I can rewrite the cyan callouts on your page in this voice (e.g., swapping “will happen” → “happens in the branch you occupy,” etc.).

karbytes:

Thanks, but I prefer not to be too biased towards a particular worldview at this time.

ChatGPT:

[Thought for 10s]

Totally fair. Here’s a worldview-neutral (operational) way to phrase things for your page and image—no commitment to any interpretation:

Interpretation-agnostic facts you can use

Tunneling & rates: Vacuum bubbles nucleate stochastically with well-defined rates Γ_𝑖 (from bounce actions). Exact where/when/channel is unpredictable; the statistics are fixed by the microphysics.

Two bubble types:

Lower-energy interior (true vacuum): wall expands at ~c and converts the surrounding region. Outside, there’s no advance visual warning; you see normal light until the wall arrives.

Higher-energy interior (false vacuum): wall collapses. With gravity, the exterior settles into a black hole; behind the horizon the interior can inflate, forming a causally separate “baby-universe” region. The connecting throat pinches off (no signals either way afterward).

Decoupled evolutions: After pinch-off, the baby universe’s evolution (often ongoing expansion) is independent of the exterior black hole’s later history (accretion or Hawking evaporation).

Non-traversable: The connection is not a traversable wormhole; no practical way to send objects or durable messages through.

Energy bookkeeping: Local conservation holds; there’s no global energy ledger for an expanding spacetime. Vacuum density stays (approximately) constant, so vacuum energy in a growing region increases without violating local conservation.

Drop-in, neutral captions for your diagram

Right panel (cyan lattice): Interior region undergoes vacuum-driven expansion (magenta arrows). This evolution is causally separate from the exterior once the throat pinches off.

Note: Lensing/distortion shown schematically; horizon and wall locations not to scale.
