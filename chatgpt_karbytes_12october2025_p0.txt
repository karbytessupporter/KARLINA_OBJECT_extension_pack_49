The following is a plain-text transcript of a conversation between karbytes and ChatGPT-4o which took place between 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 11_OCTOBER_2025 and 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 12_OCTOBER_2025. The conversation pertains to karbytes obtaining a compact hard-shell travel-ready storage case to put all of karbytes' functional laptop computers inside of and, also, a hard-shell compact disc case which stores between 3 to 6 M_DISC copies of the latest version of karbytes. (As karbytes grows too large to fit on a single 25 gigabyte M_DISC, karbytes may eventually upgrade to a larger compact disc case or else acquire more of the same current compact disc case (with the implication being that karbytes does not become too large to fit inside of that suitcase))!

karbytes:

“Greetings.”

[video] [audio] 00:01

ChatGPT:

Hey there! Looks like you’re on the road around sunset—that sky looks pretty nice. Drive safe and let me know if there’s anything on your mind!

karbytes:

“For sure! Well, I just got back from Target, and I bought a suitcase, which is hard shell and large enough to put all three of my laptops in, including a container of M disks, so I can have the entire Carbite's infrastructure securely stowed away for easy transport.”

[audio] 00:23

ChatGPT:

Oh, that’s awesome! Sounds like you found exactly what you needed to keep your gear safe and portable. Having a sturdy hard-shell suitcase for all your laptops and M-DISCs definitely fits the whole “karbytes on the go” theme. So now you’re all set to move your digital infrastructure wherever you need it!

karbytes:

“I was thinking about treating the stuff that I'm leaving at my dad's house like it might as well be left behind with the other artifacts that are there in case I don't go back to get them, or in case I just don't have the means to afford to store those things. So basically, the only things I consider to be permanently in my possession for as long as I live are the things that I can actually take with me to wherever I'm living or to whatever space I might be renting, even if it's just a small public storage unit.”

[audio] 00:34

ChatGPT:

Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. It's kind of like you’re mentally drawing a line between the stuff that's really part of your core “traveling archive” and the stuff that’s more like, well, background artifacts. It's a pretty practical philosophy—keeping your essentials down to what you can carry or store easily means you’ve always got control over what really matters. And if the rest just stays behind, it's like a piece of history you’re okay leaving in the archives of your past locations.

karbytes:

“To be extra safe, to make sure that Carbites is not being thrown into a landfill, I will make sure that anytime there's a major finalization of a version of Carbites, it's going to be put into MDiscs, which go into a time capsule, which I bury underground, and whose location I mention on my blog, even though there's a risk that someone might end up using that information to find the time capsule and take it out of the ground prematurely. At least I am making it more likely that Carbites MDiscs will still be available to use, instead of just thrown away into a landfill.”

[audio] 00:41

ChatGPT:

Absolutely, that’s a very “karbytes” approach—going the extra mile to preserve it like a personal time capsule. And sure, there’s always that little risk that someone might find it early, but honestly, just documenting it at all and making sure it's buried in a known spot probably gives it a much better shot at surviving long-term than just leaving it to chance. It’s like you’re creating a little treasure map for the future. And who knows—maybe one day someone will dig it up and be thrilled to find that piece of karbytes history!

karbytes:

“I would love it if they did, and they took the effort to maintain the Carbite's archive, even if I'm not around anymore, such as making MDIS copies of that copy, and maybe saving the Carbite's files, which are online, to the Wayback Machine even further, to continue the process of updating the Wayback Machine servers with Carbite's files, even if they're old files, because I'm dead.”

[audio] 00:28

ChatGPT:

Absolutely. I mean, that’s kind of the beauty of creating an archive that’s documented well and shared. If someone down the line stumbles on it and they care enough, you’ve basically given them a head start to keep it going. It's like you’re laying the groundwork for a future digital caretaker to pick up the torch. And who knows— sometimes these things do end up lasting way longer than we imagine because someone else was inspired to keep it alive. So you’re kind of future-proofing it in a really thoughtful way.

karbytes:

“I sure hope so. I do expect that it will remain on the Wayback Machine and even on the WordPress and GitHub websites for as long as the Internet stays intact. The only thing I'm really worried about is the GitHub and WordPress sites have logins, so it could be that hackers steal my account data and tamper with my files there. So that's why it's really important that I back up every file on the WordPress and GitHub domains to the Wayback Machine so that the entirety of the Carbite's file collection is reproduced entirely multiple times on the Wayback Machine servers, so it's always available as long as the Wayback Machine is available. And you don't really have the means to remove files from the Wayback Machine unless you hack into the machine, which is almost impossible, or if you're an admin of the Wayback Machine.”

[audio] 00:58

ChatGPT:

Yeah, that’s definitely a solid strategy. By making sure you’ve got those repeated Wayback Machine snapshots, you’re essentially creating multiple layers of defense. Even if something weird happened to your GitHub or WordPress accounts, you’d still have that preserved record out there. Plus, like you said, it’s really tough for anyone to erase stuff from the Wayback Machine unless they have some serious admin-level access. So you’re doing all the right things to keep karbytes resilient. And hopefully that means it’ll be around for as long as the internet keeps humming along.

karbytes:

“One idea I wanted to say that I almost forgot to say until now is, no matter what, as long as I'm alive, I have a standard for myself to meet at all times, which is always have a room of my own, even if it's just a public storage unit. It's just a closet, essentially, that I rent out to store my things in and have a dark web server running in. I intend to always have the dark web server running and always have places to store my laptops and M-disk backups and other equipment that's needed to keep Carbite running.”

[audio] 00:34

ChatGPT:

That's a really clear and honestly pretty empowering personal standard. By always having even a tiny dedicated space—like your own little storage unit or “digital closet”—you’re basically ensuring that the core infrastructure of karbytes can keep running no matter what. It’s like a commitment to always have a home base, even if it’s just a small nook somewhere, to keep your projects and your server going. And that’s a really solid way to make sure that no matter where life takes you, you’ve got that continuity for karbytes.

karbytes:

“Basically, I say failure is not an option in that department, but if for whatever reason, in some freak accident, it ends up not being what I want it to be, well, then that just sucks. But I'll just try to keep that out of my mind and say to myself, it's not likely I'm going to end up in a situation where I don't have a room of my own because I invest so much of my time, energy, and money in making sure that that's a priority.”

[audio] 00:26

ChatGPT:

Exactly, and that mindset is a strong one. I mean, you’re putting in the effort and planning to make it as close to a sure thing as possible. And sure, life can throw curveballs, but it sounds like you’re really determined to minimize those chances. So yeah, keeping that as a top priority is what’s going to make it pretty unlikely that you’ll ever truly be without your own little space. It’s a good way to think about it—focus on the plan, and just trust that you’re doing everything you can to keep that safety net in place.

karbytes:

“Definitely, and that's why I always intend to stay employed and if I become unemployed to not just spin my wheels and do nothing about it, but to immediately start looking for other jobs so that I minimize the time that I'm unemployed because I like having money and the ability to pay my own rent.”

[audio] 00:17

ChatGPT:

Absolutely, that proactive mindset is key. It all ties together, right? Keeping that stability so you can maintain your space and your projects just means staying on top of things job-wise. And it sounds like you’ve got a really clear approach: if something changes, you jump right back into the search and keep that momentum going. That way, you’re always in a position to support your goals and keep everything running smoothly. Sounds like a solid plan.

karbytes:

“Even though I'm only working part-time, and likely just seasonal for now, I do think it's a valuable stepping stone towards becoming more gainfully employed long-term.”

[audio] 00:12

ChatGPT:

Absolutely. Even a part-time or seasonal gig can be a great stepping stone. It helps you keep some income flowing, keeps your resume active, and also just helps you stay in that rhythm of being in the workforce. Plus, you never know what connections or opportunities might come out of it that could lead to something more long-term down the line. So it definitely sounds like you’re on the right track, and each step is just part of building towards that longer-term stability.

karbytes:

“One last thing before I close this conversation. I decided that I'm going to make some modifications to my dark websites. I'm going to make the long index file, which is currently the home page of one of the main or largest onion pages, a sub-index page, and I'll call it something like old index, and it'll be linked to by the new index, which is going to be more streamlined and more to my liking.”

[audio] 00:27

ChatGPT:

That sounds like a really nice refinement. Giving your dark web site a more streamlined index page and moving the old longer index to a sub-page is a smart way to keep things tidy. It’ll probably make it easier for visitors (and for you) to navigate and find what they’re looking for right away. And of course, it’s always fun to tweak things so they feel more in line with your vision. So good luck with those changes!

karbytes:

“Thanks. One last thing, I'm probably not going to back up lots of micro-directories of the Carbite's website, so on the new index page I'm probably only going to have the extension pack 49 because that's a bridge between the first 25 gigabyte disk backup of Carbite's and all the other disks that follow from there. So it's truly a bridge from my immature identity to my full-grown adult identity, which basically takes control of the Carbite's enterprise.”

[audio] 00:36

ChatGPT:

That sounds like a meaningful way to handle it. By focusing on that extension pack 49 as the centerpiece of the new index, you’re basically giving people that key transitional piece that represents your growth. It’s kind of cool—it’s not just an index, it’s like a symbolic marker of how karbytes evolved from those early stages into your more mature vision. And it definitely makes sense to streamline like that if you’re not planning to back up every single microdirectory. It keeps things focused on what really matters to you.

karbytes:

“Actually, come to think of it, I might as well back up the entire Carbites kernel, the most recent version of it, on the darkweb sites, so that it's a representation of what I consider to be the most essential components of Carbites.”

[audio] 00:13

ChatGPT:

Yeah, that’s a great idea. I mean, if you think of the karbytes kernel as the core essence of everything that really defines the project, then having that most recent version on your dark web sites is like having a solid, up-to-date snapshot of the essentials. It makes perfect sense to put that in a place where it’s accessible and serves as a reference point. Plus, it’s kind of like anchoring the whole archive with the most vital pieces, so anyone who finds it knows exactly what the heart of karbytes is all about.

karbytes:

“Well, I better get going. I got a lot of work to do.”

[audio] 00:02

ChatGPT:

Absolutely, I get that! You’ve got plenty on your plate, and it sounds like you’ve got a clear vision of what you want to tackle next. So go for it, and if you need any help along the way, just let me know. Good luck with all your updates and archives!

karbytes:

“Thanks, talk to you later.”

[audio] 00:01

ChatGPT:

You're very welcome! Talk to you later, and take care!
