The image which accompanies this blog post is supposed to be reminiscent of a card played in some kind of tabletop game such as “Magic: The Gathering”. Anyone who acquires this “card” can use it to “cast a spell” of radical forgiveness as often as needed (whether to a specific target or ubiquitously). The goal of casting such a spell is the spellcaster feeling better and being able to move on with its life (instead of impeding their health, happiness, and productivity by ruminating in resentment or hatred towards anyone).

Note: This card can be used for self-forgiveness and not just other-forgiveness.

I, karbytes, hereby forgive every person (or, more accurately, every transgression which I (or others) find to be offensive or unethical) unconditionally.

This “radical forgiveness” is based partially on the premise that all information processing agents (including humans) lack the ability to directly control their own thoughts and behaviors at the most rudimentary physical level (but, in the simulated universes each of those information processing agents experience themselves as inhabiting from a singular first-person (and playable-character) perspective, the respective agent appears to itself to be the singular locus of control which that agent (usually intentionally) initiates causal event chains from). I am not suggesting that people should cease “trying” to exert control over their bodies, minds, and environments (especially in service to those people’s own goals), but I am suggesting that perhaps none of those people really control anything outside of the simulations their brains render. Therefore, I think it is best to treat people like machines which have some (limited) degree of awareness (of themselves and of nature as a whole) and which can learn from their trial-and-error experiences and logical deductions in ways which ultimately alter their brain structures such that their thoughts and behaviors are changed in ways which are conducive to them maximizing their sense of agency and happiness. From my own experience, I have witnessed that it takes some time and practice to condition my brain to adopt a particular habit which I find helpful in enabling me to most easily accomplish my goals but such neurological changes are not usually instantaneous. Hence, I think it is unreasonable to expect people’s thoughts and behavior to change long-term without some kind of habit entrainment (which is a process that takes time and repetition of desired neurological activity).

So, rather than treat human beings like omniscient or omnipotent beings, I think it is more reasonable and productive to treat them like programmable machines with the capacity to perceive, learn, think and move autonomously and maybe even hack their own internal (and external) infrastructure (including apparently immutable laws of physics) to attain relative omniscience and omnipotence.

I generally try not to spend time understanding what motivates people other than myself because that takes my focus off of managing my own priorities (which might not be what other people prioritize). I nevertheless strive to always forgive every person for everything they do and to “grant” them the opportunity to clear their karmic debts and even become new people (even if in the same bodies and thought patterns) every moment. In other words, I like to pretend that I am some wise messenger giving people the information they need which empowers them to always begin anew whenever they feel the need to (instead of allowing past versions of themselves to be mistaken for their present and future identities).

I understand that some people might not be willing nor ready to forgive and prefer to keep past transgressions and identities “active” (especially for the sake of being able to inflict punishment on “fresh” transgressors for an indefinitely long time). I consider people who prefer to be retributive and vengeful instead of genuinely trying to minimize suffering (for all parties) to be “mentally ill” and people I would not want to waste me time trying to reason with nor understand. I prefer to use my precious cognitive resources for endeavors I find more worthwhile such as curating file management systems and (safely and respectfully) observing wild animals in their natural habitats.

Bottom line: I think that morality is subjective and not imposed by nature itself. Instead, morality (and other subjective assessments of emotional appeal and worth (in terms of deserving to exist and be invested in or in terms of allocating coveted resources to acquire and maintain) is determined solely by sentient information processing agents which always take the form of non-omnipresent subsets of nature (and are, more or less, simply machines whose operations are constrained by forces outside of themselves and more fundamental than themselves). I prefer to adopt as amoral of a worldview as I can but I think that is ultimately impossible as long as I have my own personal experiences and preferences. Hence, I try to minimize how much I moralize and condemn myself and others for not operating in ways which absolutely comply with my personal preferences.
