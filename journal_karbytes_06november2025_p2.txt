// 1. Splitting one Gzip-compressed FASTA file into multiple <=5 megabyte chunk files:

karbytes changed the name of the .fasta.gz file from KarlinaBeringer-SQ873FU8-30x-WGS-Sequencing_com-11-06-25.1.fasta.gz to karbytes_sequencing_dot_com_30x_genome_SQ873FU8.fasta.gz.

Then karbytes split that .fasta.gz file into multiple chunks each no larger than 5 megabytes using the following Unix shell (bash) command:

[bash]

split -b 5M -d --suffix-length=4 karbytes_sequencing_dot_com_30x_genome_SQ873FU8.fasta.gz karbytes_sequencing_dot_com_30x_genome_SQ873FU8_chunk_

[end bash]

A total of 2,998 chunk files were created. 

The first of those files is named karbytes_sequencing_dot_com_30x_genome_SQ873FU8_chunk_0000.

The last of those files is named karbytes_sequencing_dot_com_30x_genome_SQ873FU8_chunk_2997.

// 2. Recombining the chunk files into the original FASTA file:

karbytes ran the following Unix shell command to combine all the chunk files into the same FASTA file which those chunk files were created from.

[bash]

cat karbytes_sequencing_dot_com_30x_genome_SQ873FU8_chunk_* > karbytes_sequencing_dot_com_30x_genome_SQ873FU8.fasta.gz

[end bash]

// 3. Verifying that original and recombined FASTA files have identical checksums:

karbytes ran the following Unix shell command on both (Gzip-compressed) FASTA files in order to verify that their checksums are identical (which means that there were apparently no errors during the file compression, splitting, and combining processes).

[bash]

sha256sum karbytes_sequencing_dot_com_30x_genome_SQ873FU8.fasta.gz

[end bash]

The result of that command for the original FASTA file is as follows: 5898744ef0b3c7f41e4f4cf4f5078acfde93a6dfea1b44529e8f81f4ef676331  karbytes_sequencing_dot_com_30x_genome_SQ873FU8.fasta.gz

The result of that command for the newer (concatenated) FASTA file is as follows: 5898744ef0b3c7f41e4f4cf4f5078acfde93a6dfea1b44529e8f81f4ef676331  karbytes_sequencing_dot_com_30x_genome_SQ873FU8.fasta.gz

Because both results are identical, it can be assumed that karbytes' FASTA file has been successfully split and concatenated.
