Description of the karbytes_ontology page and linked pages

karbytes_ontology (27 September 2025)

This page is part of KARBYTES_FOR_LIFE_BLOG, a WordPress site created by karbytes (Karlina Ray Beringer) to archive metaphysical ideas, technical notes and software. The karbytes_ontology page presents the author’s ontological assumptions and defines several core philosophical terms. The opening paragraph explains that the list of terms outlines karbytes’ ontological framework—“a set of assumptions about what ultimately constitutes reality and how it behaves”. The page directs readers to a companion page containing the author’s primary values and notes that the current document is an updated version of an archived edition.

Content summary

* Solipsism – The page defines solipsism as the “inevitable condition of any frame of reference being aware only of what it contains.” A frame of reference (denoted R) is only aware of the qualia it renders at each moment, so R(t) represents the qualia at time t and the sum of all R(t) events constitutes the agent’s timeline.

* Selfishness – The author describes selfishness as the tendency for any information‑processing agent to focus only on the phenomena occurring within its own solipsistic awareness. Such agents make decisions and evaluate sensory or computational feedback solely in terms of their own goals. The page emphasizes that an agent cannot implement altruistic behavior that does not ultimately support its own goal‑pursuit.

* Hedonism – Hedonism is defined as the general tendency of a sentient information‑processing agent to avoid pain and attempt to experience pleasure.

* Determinism – Determinism is described as the tendency for the qualia an agent observes to follow predictable, recurrent patterns. Later the author clarifies that determinism is the causal relationship between successive events, while indeterminism refers to events without a prior cause.

* Laws of physics and mathematics – The page treats the laws of physics as assumptions about how discrete allocations of matter and energy interact and evolve over time. Mathematics is portrayed as a set of immutable logical rules about numbers; for example, “1 = 1” and “1 = 2 – 1” are always true.

* Metadata – The page states that it was last updated on 27 September 2025 and that its content is licensed as public domain.

Links from this page

The karbytes_ontology page links to several other pages. Each linked page is summarized below.

karbytes_primary_values (25 September 2025)
The companion page lists the author’s current core values. It explains that the values are ranked by importance to karbytes:

1. Nature – defined as the single, all‑encompassing set containing all phenomena, all noumena, pure non‑generative nothingness and pure generative nothingness.

2. Consciousness – the capacity for an allocation of nature to render subjective qualia (sensory data or abstract thoughts). Consciousness can vary in how much and what types of qualia a particular information‑processing agent or frame of reference renders.

3. Logic – described as components of nature interacting consistently and rule‑based, especially regarding abstract entities such as symbols and quantities.

4. Comfort – the perception of pleasure being more prominent than pain and the minimization of pain.

This page notes that it is an updated version of an archived edition and is also licensed as public domain.

karbytes_primary_values_13june2025 (archived version)
An older version of the values page preserves karbytes’ priorities as of 13 June 2025. It lists five values:

1. Truth – defined as reality itself; “the way everything is actually configured”.

2. Autonomy – the capacity of an information‑processing agent to set and achieve its own goals.

3. Innovation – a system’s ability to change in novel ways that enable it or its agents to achieve their goals.

4. Comfort – similar to the updated page, described as experiencing tolerable pain while still feeling pleasure.

5. Kindness – behavior aimed at maximizing the comfort of all sentient agents.

The archive notes that it was taken from the 13 June 2025 version of the primary values page and is also public‑domain content.

karbytes_ontology_02september2025 (archived ontology)
This archived page captures the ontological definitions as they appeared on 2 September 2025. It repeats some definitions and adds further detail:

* Hedonism is described as the propensity of sufficiently complex information‑processing agents to minimize suffering and maximize pleasure. The author notes that hedonism is the basic heuristic guiding sentient beings’ priorities.

* Compatibilism – defined as the worldview that free will (agency) is an emergent property of deterministic factors. Free will exists only within an agent’s mental model and is partly illusory. The degree of free will depends on the agent’s internal hardware, software and environment. The page even proposes a formula for an agent’s degree of agency based on the number of options it can imagine and its cumulative goal‑attainment success rate.

* Mathematics – described as abstract logical relationships between numbers that are universally true throughout all of space, time, matter, energy and even nothingness. Mathematics also describes physical reality through laws that model patterns in empirical data.

The page again notes the last update date (27 September 2025) and public‑domain status.

karbytes_ontology_31july2025 (older archived ontology)
The 31 July 2025 version of karbytes_ontology includes additional definitions and commentary not present in the latest version:

* Nihilism – defined as the belief that purpose and ethics are arbitrary processes generated by “sufficiently complex” information‑processing agents. They are not immutable properties of nature. The author contrasts this with mathematical rules relating numbers, which he regards as immutable. The page states that karbytes holds a nihilistic worldview.

* Solipsism – elaborated on at length. The page describes solipsism as the belief that the only knowledge available to any agent is the information rendered by its own hardware/software. Karbytes identifies as a “relative solipsist,” acknowledging that phenomena may exist outside his awareness but adopting an indifferent attitude toward unexperienced phenomena. The page explains that only current experiences, memories or abstract thoughts are relevant.

* Compatibilism vs. Determinism – The author argues that free will is an emergent property of deterministic processes. He distinguishes between “hard determinism” (no free will) and compatibilism and asserts that self‑aware agents experience relative free will because of informational incompleteness.

This page also links to the_cosmos_as_fundamentally_digital, a separate article exploring digital physics.

the_cosmos_as_fundamentally_digital (31 July 2025 entry)
Linked from the 31 July 2025 ontology, this extensive page contains a transcript of a conversation between karbytes and ChatGPT‑4o about the hypothesis that reality is fundamentally digital. Key points include:

* The conversation occurred between 29 July and 30 July 2025.

* Karbytes proposes that all physical phenomena are reducible to discrete digital units and occur within a substrate of finite spatial dimensions but infinite temporal duration.

* ChatGPT summarises the idea of a “fundamentally digital” universe and relates it to existing frameworks such as digital physics, loop quantum gravity, cellular automaton universes and information‑theoretic physics.

* The discussion notes that if reality is digital, infinity and continuity might be approximations rather than literal physical features. ChatGPT suggests potential consequences: a finite state universe, modified path integrals in quantum mechanics, and viewing consciousness as patterns in a discrete information substrate.

* Karbytes clarifies that the conversation is linked back to the karbytes_ontology page, highlighting the relationship between the ontological assumptions and the digital‑cosmos hypothesis.

Other linked pages via navigation menus
The karbytes_ontology page and its linked pages include navigation menus pointing to other parts of karbytes’ web‑presence. For completeness:

* KARBYTES_FOR_LIFE_BLOG – the homepage provides an index of pages (unique identity, software engineering portfolio, journal entries, etc.) and states that the site archives social‑media posts and miscellaneous files. It notes that each page is saved to the Wayback Machine and that the content is authored by karbytes (Karlina Ray Beringer). The author details and contact information are listed.

* karlina_object – another WordPress site linked via the menu. It introduces itself as an expression of one person’s interest in metaphysics, physics, computer science and mathematics. Its directory lists many technical pages (e.g., AGENCY, NATURE, NUMBERS, algorithms and geometry topics). These pages offer formal definitions and interactive components; for example, the AGENCY page defines agency as an emergent property of sufficiently complex information‑processing agents and explains what an information‑processing agent is. The ontology page links to this site for deeper definitions (e.g., information‑processing agent, mental model, numbers, causation).

Summary

The karbytes_ontology page on KARBYTES_FOR_LIFE_BLOG presents karbytes’ personal ontology—an assemblage of philosophical assumptions about reality. It defines concepts such as solipsism, selfishness, hedonism, determinism, physical laws and mathematics and situates these within a broader worldview. The page is part of a network of interlinked pages that document the author’s evolving ideas and values. Linked pages include:

* karbytes_primary_values and its archive, which list the values currently prioritized by karbytes.

* karbytes_ontology_02september2025 and karbytes_ontology_31july2025, archived editions preserving earlier versions of the author’s definitions and adding discussions of nihilism, compatibilism and free‑will.
