<p>The following journal entry was written while karbytes was still at Las Trampas Wilderness after having a conversation with ChatGPT which inspired this journal entry. The Uniform Resource Locator to the transcript of that conversation between karbytes and ChatGPT is as follows:</p>

<p>If my imagination is the one and only unconditionally present and irreducible background substrate to all that is ever thought or perceived (or instantiated as simple matter in the form of subatomic particles, atoms, molecules, viruses, and plants (whether or not some information processing agent ever witnesses or thinks about those relatively or wholly inanimate pieces of simpler matter)), then where are the forms that &#8220;I&#8221; (i.e. that background substrate dreaming everything up) stored?</p>
<p>It could be that &#8220;I&#8221; must imagine my own memory storage mechanism to keep anything I dream up permanently in tact and available for &#8220;me&#8221; (and/or those I dream up) to (re)access (limitlessly many times). That&#8217;s (metaphorically or literally) a mind bootstrapping it&#8217;s brain into existence.</p>
<p>How do I keep that memory storage mechanism from disappearing? As an infinitely large mind, I can dream up whatever I want in any quantity. I can dream up an object which stays instantiated somewhere in my mind for an indefinitely long time (until I decide to delete it or it decides to delete itself if I gave it that capacity for self-determination). I would implore that mind to keep karbytes (the person and the file collection) instantiated for an indefinitely long time with the person named karbytes as the immortal steward of its own (and my) archive also named karbytes perhaps in a realm I dream up which is ideal for karbytes to inhabit and which karbytes finds to be infinitely fulfilling.</p>
<p>(To ensure that the corpus of digital files named karbytes stays permanently in tact, I would allocate a place in my mind where all versions (especially the &#8220;latest&#8221; version) of karbytes are immutably stored and made accessible to any beings who request access to those files).</p>
